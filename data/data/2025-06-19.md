Abstract: Aiming at the problem of difficulty in accurately identifying graphical
implicit correlations in multimodal irony detection tasks, this paper proposes
a Semantic Irony Recognition Network (SemIRNet). The model contains three main
innovations: (1) The ConceptNet knowledge base is introduced for the first time
to acquire conceptual knowledge, which enhances the model's common-sense
reasoning ability; (2) Two cross-modal semantic similarity detection modules at
the word level and sample level are designed to model graphic-textual
correlations at different granularities; and (3) A contrastive learning loss
function is introduced to optimize the spatial distribution of the sample
features, which improves the separability of positive and negative samples.
Experiments on a publicly available multimodal irony detection benchmark
dataset show that the accuracy and F1 value of this model are improved by 1.64%
and 2.88% to 88.87% and 86.33%, respectively, compared with the existing
optimal methods. Further ablation experiments verify the important role of
knowledge fusion and semantic similarity detection in improving the model
performance.

Abstract: As Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) continue to evolve, their
cognitive and reasoning capabilities have seen remarkable progress. However,
challenges in visual fine-grained perception and commonsense causal inference
persist. This paper introduces Argus Inspection, a multimodal benchmark with
two levels of difficulty, emphasizing detailed visual recognition while
incorporating real-world commonsense understanding to evaluate causal reasoning
abilities. Expanding on it, we present the Eye of Panoptes framework, which
integrates a binary parametric Sigmoid metric with an indicator function,
enabling a more holistic evaluation of MLLMs' responses in opinion-based
reasoning tasks. Experiments conducted on 26 mainstream MLLMs reveal that the
highest performance in visual fine-grained reasoning reaches only 0.46,
highlighting considerable potential for enhancement. Our research offers
valuable perspectives for the continued refinement of MLLMs.

### [4] [ViLLa: A Neuro-Symbolic approach for Animal Monitoring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14823)
*Harsha Koduri*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ViLLa是一个神经符号框架，用于可解释的动物监测，结合视觉检测、语言解析和符号推理，回答自然语言查询。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一个能够结合视觉数据和自然语言查询的系统，以透明和模块化的方式监测动物种群。

Result: 系统在动物图像任务中表现良好，能够将视觉内容与结构化查询结合。

Conclusion: ViLLa提供了一种透明且模块化的方法，优于端到端黑盒模型。

Abstract: Monitoring animal populations in natural environments requires systems that
can interpret both visual data and human language queries. This work introduces
ViLLa (Vision-Language-Logic Approach), a neuro-symbolic framework designed for
interpretable animal monitoring. ViLLa integrates three core components: a
visual detection module for identifying animals and their spatial locations in
images, a language parser for understanding natural language queries, and a
symbolic reasoning layer that applies logic-based inference to answer those
queries. Given an image and a question such as "How many dogs are in the
scene?" or "Where is the buffalo?", the system grounds visual detections into
symbolic facts and uses predefined rules to compute accurate answers related to
count, presence, and location. Unlike end-to-end black-box models, ViLLa
separates perception, understanding, and reasoning, offering modularity and
transparency. The system was evaluated on a range of animal imagery tasks and
demonstrates the ability to bridge visual content with structured,
human-interpretable queries.

### [5] [GraphGSOcc: Semantic and Geometric Graph Transformer for 3D Gaussian Splating-based Occupancy Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14825)
*Ke Song,Yunhe Wu,Chunchit Siu,Huiyuan Xiong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出GraphGSOcc模型，通过结合语义和几何图Transformer解决3D高斯泼溅方法中的特征聚合和边界模糊问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D高斯泼溅方法在特征聚合时忽略语义相关性，且边界模糊问题严重。

Method: 提出Dual Gaussians Graph Attention，动态构建几何图和语义图，结合多尺度图注意力框架优化边界和拓扑。

Result: 在SurroundOcc数据集上mIoU达24.10%，GPU内存降至6.1GB，性能提升1.97%，内存减少13.7%。

Conclusion: GraphGSOcc模型有效提升了3D语义占用预测的性能和效率。

Abstract: Addressing the task of 3D semantic occupancy prediction for autonomous
driving, we tackle two key issues in existing 3D Gaussian Splating (3DGS)
methods: (1) unified feature aggregation neglecting semantic correlations among
similar categories and across regions, and (2) boundary ambiguities caused by
the lack of geometric constraints in MLP iterative optimization. We propose the
GraphGSOcc model, a novel framework that combines semantic and geometric graph
Transformer for 3D Gaussian Splating-based Occupancy Prediction. We propose the
Dual Gaussians Graph Attenntion, which dynamically constructs dual graph
structures: a geometric graph adaptively calculating KNN search radii based on
Gaussian poses, enabling large-scale Gaussians to aggregate features from
broader neighborhoods while compact Gaussians focus on local geometric
consistency; a semantic graph retaining top-M highly correlated nodes via
cosine similarity to explicitly encode semantic relationships within and across
instances. Coupled with the Multi-scale Graph Attention framework, fine-grained
attention at lower layers optimizes boundary details, while coarse-grained
attention at higher layers models object-level topology. Experiments on the
SurroundOcc dataset achieve an mIoU of 24.10%, reducing GPU memory to 6.1 GB,
demonstrating a 1.97% mIoU improvement and 13.7% memory reduction compared to
GaussianWorld

### [6] [DAVID-XR1: Detecting AI-Generated Videos with Explainable Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14827)

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将AI生成视频检测视为二分类任务，缺乏透明度和细粒度证据，难以说服用户和审计者。

Result: 模型在多种生成器和模式下表现出强泛化能力，验证了可解释检测方法的潜力。

Conclusion: 可解释检测方法为AI生成视频的可靠识别提供了透明和可验证的解决方案。

Abstract: As AI-generated video becomes increasingly pervasive across media platforms,
the ability to reliably distinguish synthetic content from authentic footage
has become both urgent and essential. Existing approaches have primarily
treated this challenge as a binary classification task, offering limited
insight into where or why a model identifies a video as AI-generated. However,
the core challenge extends beyond simply detecting subtle artifacts; it
requires providing fine-grained, persuasive evidence that can convince auditors
and end-users alike. To address this critical gap, we introduce DAVID-X, the
first dataset to pair AI-generated videos with detailed defect-level,
temporal-spatial annotations and written rationales. Leveraging these rich
annotations, we present DAVID-XR1, a video-language model designed to deliver
an interpretable chain of visual reasoning-including defect categorization,
temporal-spatial localization, and natural language explanations. This approach
fundamentally transforms AI-generated video detection from an opaque black-box
decision into a transparent and verifiable diagnostic process. We demonstrate
that a general-purpose backbone, fine-tuned on our compact dataset and enhanced
with chain-of-thought distillation, achieves strong generalization across a
variety of generators and generation modes. Our results highlight the promise
of explainable detection methods for trustworthy identification of AI-generated
video content.

*Kiet Dang Vu,Trung Thai Tran,Duc Dung Nguyen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MonoVQD是一个基于DETR的单目3D检测框架，通过引入掩码分离自注意力机制、变分查询去噪技术和自蒸馏策略，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决DETR架构在单目3D检测中的固有局限性，提升检测性能。

Method: 1. 掩码分离自注意力机制；2. 变分查询去噪技术；3. 自蒸馏策略。

Result: 在KITTI单目基准测试中表现优异，并在nuScenes多视图3D检测中展现泛化能力。

Conclusion: MonoVQD通过创新方法显著提升了单目3D检测性能，并具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Precisely localizing 3D objects from a single image constitutes a central
challenge in monocular 3D detection. While DETR-like architectures offer a
powerful paradigm, their direct application in this domain encounters inherent
limitations, preventing optimal performance. Our work addresses these
challenges by introducing MonoVQD, a novel framework designed to fundamentally
advance DETR-based monocular 3D detection. We propose three main contributions.
First, we propose the Mask Separated Self-Attention mechanism that enables the
integration of the denoising process into a DETR architecture. This improves
the stability of Hungarian matching to achieve a consistent optimization
objective. Second, we present the Variational Query Denoising technique to
address the gradient vanishing problem of conventional denoising methods, which
severely restricts the efficiency of the denoising process. This explicitly
introduces stochastic properties to mitigate this fundamental limitation and
unlock substantial performance gains. Finally, we introduce a sophisticated
self-distillation strategy, leveraging insights from later decoder layers to
synergistically improve query quality in earlier layers, thereby amplifying the
iterative refinement process. Rigorous experimentation demonstrates that
MonoVQD achieves superior performance on the challenging KITTI monocular
benchmark. Highlighting its broad applicability, MonoVQD's core components
seamlessly integrate into other architectures, delivering significant
performance gains even in multi-view 3D detection scenarios on the nuScenes
dataset and underscoring its robust generalization capabilities.

### [11] [Improved Iterative Refinement for Chart-to-Code Generation via Structured Instruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14837)
*Chengzhi Xu,Yuyang Wang,Lai Wei,Lichao Sun,Weiran Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于结构化指令的迭代优化方法ChartIR，用于提升多模态大语言模型在图表到代码生成任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管多模态大语言模型在视觉任务中表现优异，但在图表到代码生成任务中表现不佳，需要同时具备精确的视觉理解和代码翻译能力。

Method: 方法分为两部分：1）通过描述和差异两种结构化指令将视觉特征转化为语言表示；2）将生成过程分解为初始代码生成和迭代优化两阶段。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在开源模型Qwen2-VL和闭源模型GPT-4o上均优于其他方法。

Conclusion: ChartIR通过结构化指令和迭代优化显著提升了图表到代码生成的性能。

Abstract: Recently, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have attracted increasing
research attention due to their powerful visual understanding capabilities.
While they have achieved impressive results on various vision tasks, their
performance on chart-to-code generation remains suboptimal. This task requires
MLLMs to generate executable code that can reproduce a given chart, demanding
not only precise visual understanding but also accurate translation of visual
elements into structured code. Directly prompting MLLMs to perform this complex
task often yields unsatisfactory results. To address this challenge, we propose
{ChartIR}, an iterative refinement method based on structured instruction.
First, we distinguish two tasks: visual understanding and code translation. To
accomplish the visual understanding component, we design two types of
structured instructions: description and difference. The description
instruction captures the visual elements of the reference chart, while the
difference instruction characterizes the discrepancies between the reference
chart and the generated chart. These instructions effectively transform visual
features into language representations, thereby facilitating the subsequent
code translation process. Second, we decompose the overall chart generation
pipeline into two stages: initial code generation and iterative refinement,
enabling progressive enhancement of the final output. Experimental results show
that, compared to other method, our method achieves superior performance on
both the open-source model Qwen2-VL and the closed-source model GPT-4o.

TL;DR: PictSure是一个专注于图像嵌入模型的ICL框架，通过系统分析嵌入模型的架构、预训练和微调策略，显著提升了少样本图像分类的跨域性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在数据稀缺领域，传统图像分类模型难以构建，ICL成为少样本分类的潜在解决方案，但现有研究忽视了图像嵌入模型的关键作用。

Method: PictSure框架系统研究了不同视觉编码器类型、预训练目标和微调策略对少样本分类性能的影响。

Result: 实验表明，嵌入模型的预训练方式显著影响训练成功率和跨域性能，PictSure在跨域任务中优于现有ICL模型。

Conclusion: PictSure通过优化嵌入模型的设计和训练，提升了少样本分类的跨域泛化能力，同时保持了域内任务的竞争力。

Abstract: Building image classification models remains cumbersome in data-scarce
domains, where collecting large labeled datasets is impractical. In-context
learning (ICL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for few-shot image
classification (FSIC), enabling models to generalize across domains without
gradient-based adaptation. However, prior work has largely overlooked a
critical component of ICL-based FSIC pipelines: the role of image embeddings.
In this work, we present PictSure, an ICL framework that places the embedding
model -- its architecture, pretraining, and training dynamics -- at the center
of analysis. We systematically examine the effects of different visual encoder
types, pretraining objectives, and fine-tuning strategies on downstream FSIC
performance. Our experiments show that the training success and the
out-of-domain performance are highly dependent on how the embedding models are
pretrained. Consequently, PictSure manages to outperform existing ICL-based
FSIC models on out-of-domain benchmarks that differ significantly from the
training distribution, while maintaining comparable results on in-domain tasks.

### [13] [Finding Optimal Kernel Size and Dimension in Convolutional Neural Networks An Architecture Optimization Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14846)
*Shreyas Rajeev,B Sathish Babu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于数学和实证的框架BKSEF，用于优化CNN中逐层的卷积核大小选择，平衡信息增益、计算效率和准确性。实验表明，BKSEF在多个数据集上显著提升了模型性能并降低了计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 卷积核大小是CNN设计中常被忽视但关键的因素，影响感受野、特征提取、计算成本和模型精度。本文旨在通过BKSEF框架优化这一选择。

Method: BKSEF整合了信息论、信号处理和学习理论的原理，通过数学和实证方法确定最优卷积核大小。

Result: 在多个数据集上，BKSEF引导的模型实现了最高3.1%的精度提升和42.8%的FLOPs减少。实际案例验证了其在医疗图像分类和交通标志识别中的有效性。

Conclusion: BKSEF为CNN设计提供了理论和实践支持，表明卷积核大小是可优化的参数而非固定启发式，适合集成到神经架构搜索和实时系统中。

Abstract: Kernel size selection in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) is a critical
but often overlooked design decision that affects receptive field, feature
extraction, computational cost, and model accuracy. This paper proposes the
Best Kernel Size Estimation Function (BKSEF), a mathematically grounded and
empirically validated framework for optimal, layer-wise kernel size
determination. BKSEF balances information gain, computational efficiency, and
accuracy improvements by integrating principles from information theory, signal
processing, and learning theory. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100,
ImageNet-lite, ChestX-ray14, and GTSRB datasets demonstrate that BKSEF-guided
architectures achieve up to 3.1 percent accuracy improvement and 42.8 percent
reduction in FLOPs compared to traditional models using uniform 3x3 kernels.
Two real-world case studies further validate the approach: one for medical
image classification in a cloud-based setup, and another for traffic sign
recognition on edge devices. The former achieved enhanced interpretability and
accuracy, while the latter reduced latency and model size significantly, with
minimal accuracy trade-off. These results show that kernel size can be an
active, optimizable parameter rather than a fixed heuristic. BKSEF provides
practical heuristics and theoretical support for researchers and developers
seeking efficient and application-aware CNN designs. It is suitable for
integration into neural architecture search pipelines and real-time systems,
offering a new perspective on CNN optimization.

### [14] [Efficient Retail Video Annotation: A Robust Key Frame Generation Approach for Product and Customer Interaction Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14854)
*Varun Mannam,Zhenyu Shi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于深度学习的零售视频自动标注方法，显著提升效率并降低成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统零售视频标注依赖人工，耗时且成本高，需要自动化解决方案。

Method: 利用深度神经网络学习视频帧特征，结合目标检测技术实现自动标注。

Result: 方法精度接近人工标注，效率提升2倍，仅需人工验证5%的帧。

Conclusion: 该方法显著降低零售视频标注成本，适用于多种零售场景。

Abstract: Accurate video annotation plays a vital role in modern retail applications,
including customer behavior analysis, product interaction detection, and
in-store activity recognition. However, conventional annotation methods heavily
rely on time-consuming manual labeling by human annotators, introducing
non-robust frame selection and increasing operational costs. To address these
challenges in the retail domain, we propose a deep learning-based approach that
automates key-frame identification in retail videos and provides automatic
annotations of products and customers. Our method leverages deep neural
networks to learn discriminative features by embedding video frames and
incorporating object detection-based techniques tailored for retail
environments. Experimental results showcase the superiority of our approach
over traditional methods, achieving accuracy comparable to human annotator
labeling while enhancing the overall efficiency of retail video annotation.
Remarkably, our approach leads to an average of 2 times cost savings in video
annotation. By allowing human annotators to verify/adjust less than 5% of
detected frames in the video dataset, while automating the annotation process
for the remaining frames without reducing annotation quality, retailers can
significantly reduce operational costs. The automation of key-frame detection
enables substantial time and effort savings in retail video labeling tasks,
proving highly valuable for diverse retail applications such as shopper journey
analysis, product interaction detection, and in-store security monitoring.

*Zhengquan Zhang,Feng Xu,Mengmi Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于神经不确定性预测的主动视角选择方法（UPNet），用于高效3D重建，显著减少计算开销并保持高精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决3D重建中如何选择最具信息量的视角以减少冗余计算和提高效率的问题。

Method: 使用轻量级神经网络UPNet预测视角不确定性，结合启发式方法选择最优视角，训练3D神经渲染模型。

Result: 方法仅需一半视角即可达到与上限相当的精度，计算开销降低400倍，资源使用减少50%以上。

Conclusion: UPNet方法在高效3D重建中表现优异，且无需额外训练即可泛化到新物体类别。

Abstract: Some perspectives naturally provide more information than others. How can an
AI system determine which viewpoint offers the most valuable insight for
accurate and efficient 3D object reconstruction? Active view selection (AVS)
for 3D reconstruction remains a fundamental challenge in computer vision. The
aim is to identify the minimal set of views that yields the most accurate 3D
reconstruction. Instead of learning radiance fields, like NeRF or 3D Gaussian
Splatting, from a current observation and computing uncertainty for each
candidate viewpoint, we introduce a novel AVS approach guided by neural
uncertainty maps predicted by a lightweight feedforward deep neural network,
named UPNet. UPNet takes a single input image of a 3D object and outputs a
predicted uncertainty map, representing uncertainty values across all possible
candidate viewpoints. By leveraging heuristics derived from observing many
natural objects and their associated uncertainty patterns, we train UPNet to
learn a direct mapping from viewpoint appearance to uncertainty in the
underlying volumetric representations. Next, our approach aggregates all
previously predicted neural uncertainty maps to suppress redundant candidate
viewpoints and effectively select the most informative one. Using these
selected viewpoints, we train 3D neural rendering models and evaluate the
quality of novel view synthesis against other competitive AVS methods.
Remarkably, despite using half of the viewpoints than the upper bound, our
method achieves comparable reconstruction accuracy. In addition, it
significantly reduces computational overhead during AVS, achieving up to a 400
times speedup along with over 50\% reductions in CPU, RAM, and GPU usage
compared to baseline methods. Notably, our approach generalizes effectively to
AVS tasks involving novel object categories, without requiring any additional

TL;DR: 该论文提出了DPO-Kernels方法，用于增强文本到图像（T2I）模型的对齐性，包括混合损失、核化表示和发散选择三个维度，并引入了DETONATE基准和AQI指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 确保T2I模型生成的图像忠实于用户意图，同时保持安全性和公平性。

Method: 提出DPO-Kernels方法，结合混合损失、核化表示和发散选择，并引入DETONATE基准和AQI指标。

Result: DPO-Kernels在DETONATE基准上表现出色，通过HT-SR保持强泛化能力。

Conclusion: DPO-Kernels有效提升了T2I模型的对齐性，DETONATE和AQI为未来研究提供了新工具。

Abstract: Alignment is crucial for text-to-image (T2I) models to ensure that generated
images faithfully capture user intent while maintaining safety and fairness.
Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), prominent in large language models
(LLMs), is extending its influence to T2I systems. This paper introduces
DPO-Kernels for T2I models, a novel extension enhancing alignment across three
dimensions: (i) Hybrid Loss, integrating embedding-based objectives with
traditional probability-based loss for improved optimization; (ii) Kernelized
Representations, employing Radial Basis Function (RBF), Polynomial, and Wavelet
kernels for richer feature transformations and better separation between safe
and unsafe inputs; and (iii) Divergence Selection, expanding beyond DPO's
default Kullback-Leibler (KL) regularizer by incorporating Wasserstein and
R'enyi divergences for enhanced stability and robustness. We introduce
DETONATE, the first large-scale benchmark of its kind, comprising approximately
100K curated image pairs categorized as chosen and rejected. DETONATE
encapsulates three axes of social bias and discrimination: Race, Gender, and
Disability. Prompts are sourced from hate speech datasets, with images
generated by leading T2I models including Stable Diffusion 3.5 Large, Stable
Diffusion XL, and Midjourney. Additionally, we propose the Alignment Quality
Index (AQI), a novel geometric measure quantifying latent-space separability of
safe/unsafe image activations, revealing hidden vulnerabilities. Empirically,
we demonstrate that DPO-Kernels maintain strong generalization bounds via
Heavy-Tailed Self-Regularization (HT-SR). DETONATE and complete code are
publicly released.

Result: 在5个多图像基准和3个单图像基准上，PeRL显著优于基线方法，达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: PeRL在多图像任务中表现出色，同时保持单图像任务的性能，为多模态推理提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Inspired by the impressive reasoning capabilities demonstrated by
reinforcement learning approaches like DeepSeek-R1, recent emerging research
has begun exploring the use of reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance
vision-language models (VLMs) for multimodal reasoning tasks. However, most
existing multimodal reinforcement learning approaches remain limited to spatial
reasoning within single-image contexts, yet still struggle to generalize to
more complex and real-world scenarios involving multi-image positional
reasoning, where understanding the relationships across images is crucial. To
address this challenge, we propose a general reinforcement learning approach
PeRL tailored for interleaved multimodal tasks, and a multi-stage strategy
designed to enhance the exploration-exploitation trade-off, thereby improving
learning efficiency and task performance. Specifically, we introduce
permutation of image sequences to simulate varied positional relationships to
explore more spatial and positional diversity. Furthermore, we design a rollout
filtering mechanism for resampling to focus on trajectories that contribute
most to learning optimal behaviors to exploit learned policies effectively. We
evaluate our model on 5 widely-used multi-image benchmarks and 3 single-image
benchmarks. Our experiments confirm that PeRL trained model consistently
surpasses R1-related and interleaved VLM baselines by a large margin, achieving
state-of-the-art performance on multi-image benchmarks, while preserving
comparable performance on single-image tasks.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种针对医学图像扩散模型的频率校准重建误差（FCRE）方法，用于改进成员推断攻击（MIA），通过聚焦中频范围的重建误差，减少图像固有难度的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在医学图像生成中的广泛应用引发了隐私问题，现有MIA方法依赖重建误差，但医学图像的高频细节重建困难，导致效果不佳。

Method: 提出FCRE方法，分析反向扩散过程，计算中频重建误差和结构相似性指数，通过阈值比较确定成员身份。

Result: 在多个医学图像数据集上的实验表明，FCRE方法优于现有MIA方法。

Conclusion: FCRE方法有效解决了医学图像MIA中的挑战，为隐私风险评估提供了更可靠的工具。

Abstract: The increasing use of diffusion models for image generation, especially in
sensitive areas like medical imaging, has raised significant privacy concerns.
Membership Inference Attack (MIA) has emerged as a potential approach to
determine if a specific image was used to train a diffusion model, thus
quantifying privacy risks. Existing MIA methods often rely on diffusion
reconstruction errors, where member images are expected to have lower
reconstruction errors than non-member images. However, applying these methods
directly to medical images faces challenges. Reconstruction error is influenced
by inherent image difficulty, and diffusion models struggle with high-frequency
detail reconstruction. To address these issues, we propose a
Frequency-Calibrated Reconstruction Error (FCRE) method for MIAs on medical
image diffusion models. By focusing on reconstruction errors within a specific
mid-frequency range and excluding both high-frequency (difficult to
reconstruct) and low-frequency (less informative) regions, our
frequency-selective approach mitigates the confounding factor of inherent image
difficulty. Specifically, we analyze the reverse diffusion process, obtain the
mid-frequency reconstruction error, and compute the structural similarity index
score between the reconstructed and original images. Membership is determined
by comparing this score to a threshold. Experiments on several medical image
datasets demonstrate that our FCRE method outperforms existing MIA methods.

Abstract: Distinguishing between quark- and gluon-initiated jets is a critical and
challenging task in high-energy physics, pivotal for improving new physics
searches and precision measurements at the Large Hadron Collider. While deep
learning, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), has advanced jet
tagging using image-based representations, the potential of Vision Transformer
(ViT) architectures, renowned for modeling global contextual information,
remains largely underexplored for direct calorimeter image analysis, especially
under realistic detector and pileup conditions. This paper presents a
systematic evaluation of ViTs and ViT-CNN hybrid models for quark-gluon jet
classification using simulated 2012 CMS Open Data. We construct multi-channel
jet-view images from detector-level energy deposits (ECAL, HCAL) and
reconstructed tracks, enabling an end-to-end learning approach. Our
comprehensive benchmarking demonstrates that ViT-based models, notably
ViT+MaxViT and ViT+ConvNeXt hybrids, consistently outperform established CNN
baselines in F1-score, ROC-AUC, and accuracy, highlighting the advantage of
capturing long-range spatial correlations within jet substructure. This work
establishes the first systematic framework and robust performance baselines for
applying ViT architectures to calorimeter image-based jet classification using
public collider data, alongside a structured dataset suitable for further deep
learning research in this domain.

Abstract: Compliance is a critical parameter for describing objects in engineering,
agriculture, and biomedical applications. Traditional compliance detection
methods are limited by their lack of portability and scalability, rely on
specialized, often expensive equipment, and are unsuitable for robotic
applications. Moreover, existing neural network-based approaches using
vision-based tactile sensors still suffer from insufficient prediction
accuracy. In this paper, we propose two models based on Long-term Recurrent
Convolutional Networks (LRCNs) and Transformer architectures that leverage RGB
tactile images and other information captured by the vision-based sensor
GelSight to predict compliance metrics accurately. We validate the performance
of these models using multiple metrics and demonstrate their effectiveness in
accurately estimating compliance. The proposed models exhibit significant
performance improvement over the baseline. Additionally, we investigated the
correlation between sensor compliance and object compliance estimation, which
revealed that objects that are harder than the sensor are more challenging to
estimate.

Result: PALETTE在历史地图数据集上表现优于现有方法，已成功应用于6万张地图的文本标注。

Conclusion: PALETTE为历史地图文本识别提供了高效解决方案，并开源支持进一步研究。

Abstract: Text on historical maps contains valuable information providing georeferenced
historical, political, and cultural contexts. However, text extraction from
historical maps is challenging due to the lack of (1) effective methods and (2)
training data. Previous approaches use ad-hoc steps tailored to only specific
map styles. Recent machine learning-based text spotters (e.g., for scene
images) have the potential to solve these challenges because of their
flexibility in supporting various types of text instances. However, these
methods remain challenges in extracting precise image features for predicting
every sub-component (boundary points and characters) in a text instance. This
is critical because map text can be lengthy and highly rotated with complex
backgrounds, posing difficulties in detecting relevant image features from a
rough text region. This paper proposes PALETTE, an end-to-end text spotter for
scanned historical maps of a wide variety. PALETTE introduces a novel
hyper-local sampling module to explicitly learn localized image features around
the target boundary points and characters of a text instance for detection and
recognition. PALETTE also enables hyper-local positional embeddings to learn
spatial interactions between boundary points and characters within and across
text instances. In addition, this paper presents a novel approach to
automatically generate synthetic map images, SynthMap+, for training text
spotters for historical maps. The experiment shows that PALETTE with SynthMap+
outperforms SOTA text spotters on two new benchmark datasets of historical
maps, particularly for long and angled text. We have deployed PALETTE with
SynthMap+ to process over 60,000 maps in the David Rumsey Historical Map
collection and generated over 100 million text labels to support map searching.

Motivation: 解决传统风格迁移方法的问题，统一不同任务的框架，实现艺术级风格迁移和文本驱动风格化。

Method: 1. 基于BLIP和CLIP的语义风格注入；2. 基于人类反馈的数据增强策略；3. 无训练的三重扩散过程。

Result: 实现了高质量的图像风格迁移和文本驱动风格化，首次在风格迁移过程中实现图像颜色编辑。

Conclusion: StyleWallfacer框架在风格迁移领域取得了突破性进展，为艺术级风格迁移和文本控制提供了新方法。

Abstract: In this pioneering study, we introduce StyleWallfacer, a groundbreaking
unified training and inference framework, which not only addresses various
issues encountered in the style transfer process of traditional methods but
also unifies the framework for different tasks. This framework is designed to
revolutionize the field by enabling artist level style transfer and text driven
stylization. First, we propose a semantic-based style injection method that
uses BLIP to generate text descriptions strictly aligned with the semantics of
the style image in CLIP space. By leveraging a large language model to remove
style-related descriptions from these descriptions, we create a semantic gap.
This gap is then used to fine-tune the model, enabling efficient and drift-free
injection of style knowledge. Second, we propose a data augmentation strategy
based on human feedback, incorporating high-quality samples generated early in
the fine-tuning process into the training set to facilitate progressive
learning and significantly reduce its overfitting. Finally, we design a
training-free triple diffusion process using the fine-tuned model, which
manipulates the features of self-attention layers in a manner similar to the
cross-attention mechanism. Specifically, in the generation process, the key and
value of the content-related process are replaced with those of the
style-related process to inject style while maintaining text control over the
model. We also introduce query preservation to mitigate disruptions to the
original content. Under such a design, we have achieved high-quality
image-driven style transfer and text-driven stylization, delivering
artist-level style transfer results while preserving the original image
content. Moreover, we achieve image color editing during the style transfer
process for the first time.

Result: 实验和理论分析验证了方法的有效性，实现了近100%的码本利用率和显著降低的量化误差。

Conclusion: 通过Wasserstein距离对齐分布，有效解决了向量量化中的关键问题。

Abstract: The success of autoregressive models largely depends on the effectiveness of
vector quantization, a technique that discretizes continuous features by
mapping them to the nearest code vectors within a learnable codebook. Two
critical issues in existing vector quantization methods are training
instability and codebook collapse. Training instability arises from the
gradient discrepancy introduced by the straight-through estimator, especially
in the presence of significant quantization errors, while codebook collapse
occurs when only a small subset of code vectors are utilized during training. A
closer examination of these issues reveals that they are primarily driven by a
mismatch between the distributions of the features and code vectors, leading to
unrepresentative code vectors and significant data information loss during
compression. To address this, we employ the Wasserstein distance to align these
two distributions, achieving near 100\% codebook utilization and significantly
reducing the quantization error. Both empirical and theoretical analyses
validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Result: 实验表明，SynPo性能接近基于训练的最先进少样本方法。

Conclusion: SynPo通过优化提示质量，显著提升了无训练少样本医学图像分割的效果。

Abstract: The advent of Large Vision Models (LVMs) offers new opportunities for
few-shot medical image segmentation. However, existing training-free methods
based on LVMs fail to effectively utilize negative prompts, leading to poor
performance on low-contrast medical images. To address this issue, we propose
SynPo, a training-free few-shot method based on LVMs (e.g., SAM), with the core
insight: improving the quality of negative prompts. To select point prompts in
a more reliable confidence map, we design a novel Confidence Map Synergy Module
by combining the strengths of DINOv2 and SAM. Based on the confidence map, we
select the top-k pixels as the positive points set and choose the negative
points set using a Gaussian distribution, followed by independent K-means
clustering for both sets. Then, these selected points are leveraged as
high-quality prompts for SAM to get the segmentation results. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that SynPo achieves performance comparable to
state-of-the-art training-based few-shot methods.

Conclusion: PDSA模块有效解决了点云分析中的问题，并通过实验和可视化证明了其合理性和有效性。

Abstract: Point cloud analysis is the cornerstone of many downstream tasks, among which
aggregating local structures is the basis for understanding point cloud data.
While numerous works aggregate neighbor using three-dimensional relative
coordinates, there are irrelevant point interference and feature hierarchy gap
problems due to the limitation of local coordinates. Although some works
address this limitation by refining spatial description though explicit
modeling of cross-stage structure, these enhancement methods based on direct
geometric structure encoding have problems of high computational overhead and
noise sensitivity. To overcome these problems, we propose the Point
Distribution Set Abstraction module (PDSA) that utilizes the correlation in the
high-dimensional space to correct the feature distribution during aggregation,
which improves the computational efficiency and robustness. PDSA distinguishes
the point correlation based on a lightweight cross-stage structural descriptor,
and enhances structural homogeneity by reducing the variance of the neighbor
feature matrix and increasing classes separability though long-distance
modeling. Additionally, we introducing a key point mechanism to optimize the
computational overhead. The experimental result on semantic segmentation and
classification tasks based on different baselines verify the generalization of
the method we proposed, and achieve significant performance improvement with
less parameter cost. The corresponding ablation and visualization results
demonstrate the effectiveness and rationality of our method. The code and

Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion probabilistic models (DPMs) have
revolutionized image processing, demonstrating significant potential in medical
applications. Accurate segmentation of the left ventricle (LV) in
echocardiograms is crucial for diagnostic procedures and necessary treatments.
However, ultrasound images are notoriously noisy with low contrast and
ambiguous LV boundaries, thereby complicating the segmentation process. To
address these challenges, this paper introduces Echo-DND, a novel dual-noise
diffusion model specifically designed for this task. Echo-DND leverages a
unique combination of Gaussian and Bernoulli noises. It also incorporates a
multi-scale fusion conditioning module to improve segmentation precision.
Furthermore, it utilizes spatial coherence calibration to maintain spatial
integrity in segmentation masks. The model's performance was rigorously
validated on the CAMUS and EchoNet-Dynamic datasets. Extensive evaluations
demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms existing SOTA models. It
achieves high Dice scores of 0.962 and 0.939 on these datasets, respectively.
The proposed Echo-DND model establishes a new standard in echocardiogram
segmentation, and its architecture holds promise for broader applicability in
other medical imaging tasks, potentially improving diagnostic accuracy across
various medical domains. Project page: https://abdur75648.github.io/Echo-DND

Result: ReSeDis为多模态搜索系统提供了一个现实的测试平台，展示了未来研究的潜力。

Conclusion: ReSeDis为构建下一代稳健且可扩展的多模态搜索系统提供了新的研究方向。

Abstract: Large-scale visual search engines are expected to solve a dual problem at
once: (i) locate every image that truly contains the object described by a
sentence and (ii) identify the object's bounding box or exact pixels within
each hit. Existing techniques address only one side of this challenge. Visual
grounding yields tight boxes and masks but rests on the unrealistic assumption
that the object is present in every test image, producing a flood of false
alarms when applied to web-scale collections. Text-to-image retrieval excels at
sifting through massive databases to rank relevant images, yet it stops at
whole-image matches and offers no fine-grained localization. We introduce
Referring Search and Discovery (ReSeDis), the first task that unifies
corpus-level retrieval with pixel-level grounding. Given a free-form
description, a ReSeDis model must decide whether the queried object appears in
each image and, if so, where it is, returning bounding boxes or segmentation
masks. To enable rigorous study, we curate a benchmark in which every
description maps uniquely to object instances scattered across a large, diverse
corpus, eliminating unintended matches. We further design a task-specific
metric that jointly scores retrieval recall and localization precision.
Finally, we provide a straightforward zero-shot baseline using a frozen
vision-language model, revealing significant headroom for future study. ReSeDis
offers a realistic, end-to-end testbed for building the next generation of
robust and scalable multimodal search systems.

Abstract: Recent advancements in medical image analysis have led to the development of
highly specialized models tailored to specific clinical tasks. These models
have demonstrated exceptional performance and remain a crucial research
direction. Yet, their applicability is limited to predefined tasks, requiring
expertise and extensive resources for development and adaptation. In contrast,
generalist models offer a different form of utility: allowing medical
practitioners to define tasks on the fly without the need for task-specific
model development. In this work, we explore how to train generalist models for
the domain of retinal optical coherence tomography using visual in-context
learning (VICL), i.e., training models to generalize across tasks based on a
few examples provided at inference time. To facilitate rigorous assessment, we
propose a broad evaluation protocol tailored to VICL in OCT. We extensively
evaluate a state-of-the-art medical VICL approach on multiple retinal OCT
datasets, establishing a first baseline to highlight the potential and current
limitations of in-context learning for OCT. To foster further research and
practical adoption, we openly release our code.

Conclusion: PSIC为图像隐私保护提供了一种灵活且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: The improved semantic understanding of vision-language pretrained (VLP)
models has made it increasingly difficult to protect publicly posted images
from being exploited by search engines and other similar tools. In this
context, this paper seeks to protect users' privacy by implementing defenses at
the image compression stage to prevent exploitation. Specifically, we propose a
flexible coding method, termed Privacy-Shielded Image Compression (PSIC), that
can produce bitstreams with multiple decoding options. By default, the
bitstream is decoded to preserve satisfactory perceptual quality while
preventing interpretation by VLP models. Our method also retains the original
image compression functionality. With a customizable input condition, the
proposed scheme can reconstruct the image that preserves its full semantic
information. A Conditional Latent Trigger Generation (CLTG) module is proposed
to produce bias information based on customizable conditions to guide the

Uncertainty-Aware Encryption-Oriented (UAEO) optimization function is designed
to leverage the soft labels inferred from the target VLP model's uncertainty on

optimization strategy to obtain improved encrypting performance and perceptual
quality simultaneously within a unified training process. The proposed scheme
is plug-and-play and can be seamlessly integrated into most existing Learned
Image Compression (LIC) models. Extensive experiments across multiple
downstream tasks have demonstrated the effectiveness of our design.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于两阶段扩散模型的融合网络（DM-FNet），用于多模态医学图像融合，通过增强特征识别能力和自适应处理不同模态图像，显著提升了融合图像的质量和信息密度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态医学图像融合方法在捕捉细节特征和跨模态特征交互方面表现不足，导致融合图像质量不理想。

Method: 采用两阶段扩散模型：第一阶段通过UNet进行图像重建，捕捉细节信息；第二阶段将不同步骤的噪声图像输入融合网络，结合三个关键融合模块自适应处理不同模态图像。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在客观评价指标上表现优异，融合图像保留了适当的亮度、放射性示踪剂分布、丰富纹理和清晰边缘。

Conclusion: DM-FNet通过两阶段设计和混合损失函数，显著提升了医学图像融合的质量和信息密度。

Abstract: Multimodal medical image fusion (MMIF) extracts the most meaningful
information from multiple source images, enabling a more comprehensive and
accurate diagnosis. Achieving high-quality fusion results requires a careful
balance of brightness, color, contrast, and detail; this ensures that the fused
images effectively display relevant anatomical structures and reflect the
functional status of the tissues. However, existing MMIF methods have limited
capacity to capture detailed features during conventional training and suffer
from insufficient cross-modal feature interaction, leading to suboptimal fused
image quality. To address these issues, this study proposes a two-stage
diffusion model-based fusion network (DM-FNet) to achieve unified MMIF. In
Stage I, a diffusion process trains UNet for image reconstruction. UNet
captures detailed information through progressive denoising and represents
multilevel data, providing a rich set of feature representations for the
subsequent fusion network. In Stage II, noisy images at various steps are input
into the fusion network to enhance the model's feature recognition capability.
Three key fusion modules are also integrated to process medical images from
different modalities adaptively. Ultimately, the robust network structure and a
hybrid loss function are integrated to harmonize the fused image's brightness,
color, contrast, and detail, enhancing its quality and information density. The
experimental results across various medical image types demonstrate that the
proposed method performs exceptionally well regarding objective evaluation
metrics. The fused image preserves appropriate brightness, a comprehensive
distribution of radioactive tracers, rich textures, and clear edges. The code

Motivation: 视频包含丰富信息，生成准确的自然语言描述是视频理解的关键。

Method: 提出视频-SALMONN 2模型，结合LoRA和DPO，引入MrDPO方法，定期更新参考模型并融合真实字幕指导。

Result: 模型在7B参数下超越GPT-4o和Gemini-1.5-Pro，错误率降低28%。

Conclusion: 视频-SALMONN 2在视频字幕任务中表现优异，代码已开源。

Abstract: Videos contain a wealth of information, and generating detailed and accurate
descriptions in natural language is a key aspect of video understanding. In
this paper, we present video-SALMONN 2, an advanced audio-visual large language
model (LLM) with low-rank adaptation (LoRA) designed for enhanced video (with
paired audio) captioning through directed preference optimisation (DPO). We
propose new metrics to evaluate the completeness and accuracy of video
descriptions, which are optimised using DPO. To further improve training, we
propose a novel multi-round DPO (MrDPO) approach, which involves periodically
updating the DPO reference model, merging and re-initialising the LoRA module
as a proxy for parameter updates after each training round (1,000 steps), and
incorporating guidance from ground-truth video captions to stabilise the
process. Experimental results show that MrDPO significantly enhances
video-SALMONN 2's captioning accuracy, reducing the captioning error rates by
28\%. The final video-SALMONN 2 model, with just 7 billion parameters,
surpasses leading models such as GPT-4o and Gemini-1.5-Pro in video captioning
tasks, while maintaining highly competitive performance to the state-of-the-art
on widely used video question-answering benchmarks among models of similar
size. Codes are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAR船舶检测面临多尺度变化、小目标与噪声混合及复杂背景等挑战，需要更高效的特征表示与融合方法。

Method: C-AFBiFPN包含卷积特征增强模块（CFE）和创新的AFBiFPN网络，结合BiFormer注意力机制，提升局部细节与全局建模能力。

Result: 在SSDD数据集上的实验表明，该方法显著提高了小目标检测精度、抗遮挡鲁棒性和多尺度特征适应性。

Conclusion: C-AFBiFPN框架有效解决了SAR船舶检测中的关键问题，为相关应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) enables submeter-resolution imaging and
all-weather monitoring via active microwave and advanced signal processing.
Currently, SAR has found extensive applications in critical maritime domains
such as ship detection. However, SAR ship detection faces several challenges,
including significant scale variations among ships, the presence of small
offshore vessels mixed with noise, and complex backgrounds for large nearshore
ships. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel feature enhancement
and fusion framework named C-AFBiFPN. C-AFBiFPN constructs a Convolutional
Feature Enhancement (CFE) module following the backbone network, aiming to
enrich feature representation and enhance the ability to capture and represent
local details and contextual information. Furthermore, C-AFBiFPN innovatively
integrates BiFormer attention within the fusion strategy of BiFPN, creating the
AFBiFPN network. AFBiFPN improves the global modeling capability of cross-scale
feature fusion and can adaptively focus on critical feature regions. The
experimental results on SAR Ship Detection Dataset (SSDD) indicate that the
proposed approach substantially enhances detection accuracy for small targets,
robustness against occlusions, and adaptability to multi-scale features.

TL;DR: RA-NeRF是一种新方法，能够在复杂相机轨迹下预测高精度相机位姿，结合NeRF和光流驱动位姿调节，显著提升SLAM任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖精确相机位姿先验，复杂轨迹下表现不佳，需要更鲁棒的解决方案。

Method: 采用增量式流程，结合NeRF的光度一致性和光流驱动位姿调节，引入隐式位姿滤波器消除噪声。

Result: 在Tanks&Temple和NeRFBuster数据集上，RA-NeRF在位姿估计和视觉质量上均达到最优。

Conclusion: RA-NeRF在复杂轨迹下表现出色，为场景重建提供了高效且鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have emerged
as powerful tools for 3D reconstruction and SLAM tasks. However, their
performance depends heavily on accurate camera pose priors. Existing approaches
attempt to address this issue by introducing external constraints but fall
short of achieving satisfactory accuracy, particularly when camera trajectories
are complex. In this paper, we propose a novel method, RA-NeRF, capable of
predicting highly accurate camera poses even with complex camera trajectories.
Following the incremental pipeline, RA-NeRF reconstructs the scene using NeRF
with photometric consistency and incorporates flow-driven pose regulation to
enhance robustness during initialization and localization. Additionally,
RA-NeRF employs an implicit pose filter to capture the camera movement pattern
and eliminate the noise for pose estimation. To validate our method, we conduct
extensive experiments on the Tanks\&Temple dataset for standard evaluation, as
well as the NeRFBuster dataset, which presents challenging camera pose
trajectories. On both datasets, RA-NeRF achieves state-of-the-art results in
both camera pose estimation and visual quality, demonstrating its effectiveness
and robustness in scene reconstruction under complex pose trajectories.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为RetroMem的回忆增强COD架构，通过整合历史知识动态调整伪装模式感知与推理，显著提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有COD方法缺乏历史上下文获取机制，限制了在复杂伪装场景中的适应性和效果。

Method: 采用两阶段训练范式（学习阶段和回忆阶段），包括DMA捕获多尺度信息，DMM和IPR利用历史知识重构推理。

Result: 在多个数据集上显著优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: RetroMem通过动态整合历史知识，有效提升了伪装场景的理解能力。

Abstract: Camouflaged object detection (COD) primarily focuses on learning subtle yet
discriminative representations from complex scenes. Existing methods
predominantly follow the parametric feedforward architecture based on static
visual representation modeling. However, they lack explicit mechanisms for
acquiring historical context, limiting their adaptation and effectiveness in
handling challenging camouflage scenes. In this paper, we propose a
recall-augmented COD architecture, namely RetroMem, which dynamically modulates
camouflage pattern perception and inference by integrating relevant historical
knowledge into the process. Specifically, RetroMem employs a two-stage training
paradigm consisting of a learning stage and a recall stage to construct,
update, and utilize memory representations effectively. During the learning
stage, we design a dense multi-scale adapter (DMA) to improve the pretrained
encoder's capability to capture rich multi-scale visual information with very
few trainable parameters, thereby providing foundational inferences. In the
recall stage, we propose a dynamic memory mechanism (DMM) and an inference
pattern reconstruction (IPR). These components fully leverage the latent
relationships between learned knowledge and current sample context to
reconstruct the inference of camouflage patterns, thereby significantly
improving the model's understanding of camouflage scenes. Extensive experiments
on several widely used datasets demonstrate that our RetroMem significantly
outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: DBACS方法在半导体领域的领域自适应中表现出色，为减少资源消耗和提高效率提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: In the semiconductor sector, due to high demand but also strong and
increasing competition, time to market and quality are key factors in securing
significant market share in various application areas. Thanks to the success of
deep learning methods in recent years in the computer vision domain, Industry
4.0 and 5.0 applications, such as defect classification, have achieved
remarkable success. In particular, Domain Adaptation (DA) has proven highly
effective since it focuses on using the knowledge learned on a (source) domain
to adapt and perform effectively on a different but related (target) domain. By
improving robustness and scalability, DA minimizes the need for extensive
manual re-labeling or re-training of models. This not only reduces
computational and resource costs but also allows human experts to focus on
high-value tasks. Therefore, we tested the efficacy of DA techniques in
semi-supervised and unsupervised settings within the context of the
semiconductor field. Moreover, we propose the DBACS approach, a
CycleGAN-inspired model enhanced with additional loss terms to improve
performance. All the approaches are studied and validated on real-world
Electron Microscope images considering the unsupervised and semi-supervised
settings, proving the usefulness of our method in advancing DA techniques for
the semiconductor field.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于INR的视频压缩方法在细节密集和快速变化内容中表现不佳，主要原因是网络特征利用不足和缺乏视频特定设计。

Method: 提出MSNeRV框架，包括时间窗口增强时序一致性、GoP级网格背景表示、多尺度空间解码器和尺度自适应损失函数，以及多尺度特征块。

Result: 在HEVC ClassB和UVG数据集上，MSNeRV在INR方法中表现出色，压缩效率优于VTM-23.7（随机访问）。

Conclusion: MSNeRV通过多尺度特征融合和视频特定设计，显著提升了神经视频表示和压缩性能。

Abstract: Implicit Neural representations (INRs) have emerged as a promising approach
for video compression, and have achieved comparable performance to the
state-of-the-art codecs such as H.266/VVC. However, existing INR-based methods
struggle to effectively represent detail-intensive and fast-changing video
content. This limitation mainly stems from the underutilization of internal
network features and the absence of video-specific considerations in network
design. To address these challenges, we propose a multi-scale feature fusion
framework, MSNeRV, for neural video representation. In the encoding stage, we
enhance temporal consistency by employing temporal windows, and divide the
video into multiple Groups of Pictures (GoPs), where a GoP-level grid is used
for background representation. Additionally, we design a multi-scale spatial
decoder with a scale-adaptive loss function to integrate multi-resolution and
multi-frequency information. To further improve feature extraction, we
introduce a multi-scale feature block that fully leverages hidden features. We
evaluate MSNeRV on HEVC ClassB and UVG datasets for video representation and
compression. Experimental results demonstrate that our model exhibits superior
representation capability among INR-based approaches and surpasses VTM-23.7
(Random Access) in dynamic scenarios in terms of compression efficiency.

Conclusion: BCRNet为腹腔镜手术中的解剖结构检测提供了高效解决方案，代码将开源。

Abstract: Laparoscopic liver surgery, while minimally invasive, poses significant
challenges in accurately identifying critical anatomical structures. Augmented
reality (AR) systems, integrating MRI/CT with laparoscopic images based on
2D-3D registration, offer a promising solution for enhancing surgical
navigation. A vital aspect of the registration progress is the precise
detection of curvilinear anatomical landmarks in laparoscopic images. In this
paper, we propose BCRNet (Bezier Curve Refinement Net), a novel framework that
significantly enhances landmark detection in laparoscopic liver surgery
primarily via the Bezier curve refinement strategy. The framework starts with a
Multi-modal Feature Extraction (MFE) module designed to robustly capture
semantic features. Then we propose Adaptive Curve Proposal Initialization
(ACPI) to generate pixel-aligned Bezier curves and confidence scores for
reliable initial proposals. Additionally, we design the Hierarchical Curve
Refinement (HCR) mechanism to enhance these proposals iteratively through a
multi-stage process, capturing fine-grained contextual details from multi-scale
pixel-level features for precise Bezier curve adjustment. Extensive evaluations
on the L3D and P2ILF datasets demonstrate that BCRNet outperforms
state-of-the-art methods, achieving significant performance improvements. Code

Abstract: Facial micro-expressions (MEs) are involuntary movements of the face that
occur spontaneously when a person experiences an emotion but attempts to
suppress or repress the facial expression, typically found in a high-stakes
environment. In recent years, substantial advancements have been made in the
areas of ME recognition, spotting, and generation. However, conventional
approaches that treat spotting and recognition as separate tasks are
suboptimal, particularly for analyzing long-duration videos in realistic
settings. Concurrently, the emergence of multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) and large vision-language models (LVLMs) offers promising new avenues
for enhancing ME analysis through their powerful multimodal reasoning
capabilities. The ME grand challenge (MEGC) 2025 introduces two tasks that
reflect these evolving research directions: (1) ME spot-then-recognize
(ME-STR), which integrates ME spotting and subsequent recognition in a unified
sequential pipeline; and (2) ME visual question answering (ME-VQA), which
explores ME understanding through visual question answering, leveraging MLLMs
or LVLMs to address diverse question types related to MEs. All participating
algorithms are required to run on this test set and submit their results on a

Conclusion: OpenPath通过高效样本选择和避免OOD数据，显著提高了病理图像分类的标注效率和模型性能。

Abstract: Pathology image classification plays a crucial role in accurate medical
diagnosis and treatment planning. Training high-performance models for this
task typically requires large-scale annotated datasets, which are both
expensive and time-consuming to acquire. Active Learning (AL) offers a solution
by iteratively selecting the most informative samples for annotation, thereby
reducing the labeling effort. However, most AL methods are designed under the
assumption of a closed-set scenario, where all the unannotated images belong to
target classes. In real-world clinical environments, the unlabeled pool often
contains a substantial amount of Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) data, leading to low
efficiency of annotation in traditional AL methods. Furthermore, most existing
AL methods start with random selection in the first query round, leading to a
significant waste of labeling costs in open-set scenarios. To address these
challenges, we propose OpenPath, a novel open-set active learning approach for
pathological image classification leveraging a pre-trained Vision-Language
Model (VLM). In the first query, we propose task-specific prompts that combine
target and relevant non-target class prompts to effectively select
In-Distribution (ID) and informative samples from the unlabeled pool. In
subsequent queries, Diverse Informative ID Sampling (DIS) that includes
Prototype-based ID candidate Selection (PIS) and Entropy-Guided Stochastic
Sampling (EGSS) is proposed to ensure both purity and informativeness in a
query, avoiding the selection of OOD samples. Experiments on two public
pathology image datasets show that OpenPath significantly enhances the model's
performance due to its high purity of selected samples, and outperforms several
state-of-the-art open-set AL methods. The code is available at

Conclusion: CountVid和VideoCount为开放世界物体计数任务提供了有效解决方案，相关资源已开源。

Abstract: We introduce a new task of open-world object counting in videos: given a text
description, or an image example, that specifies the target object, the
objective is to enumerate all the unique instances of the target objects in the
video. This task is especially challenging in crowded scenes with occlusions
and similar objects, where avoiding double counting and identifying
reappearances is crucial. To this end, we make the following contributions: we
introduce a model, CountVid, for this task. It leverages an image-based
counting model, and a promptable video segmentation and tracking model to
enable automated, open-world object counting across video frames. To evaluate
its performance, we introduce VideoCount, a new dataset for our novel task
built from the TAO and MOT20 tracking datasets, as well as from videos of
penguins and metal alloy crystallization captured by x-rays. Using this
dataset, we demonstrate that CountVid provides accurate object counts, and
significantly outperforms strong baselines. The VideoCount dataset, the
CountVid model, and all the code are available at

Conclusion: 几何感知的纹理映射方法能有效提升对变形图案的个体重识别性能。

Abstract: Existing individual re-identification methods often struggle with the
deformable nature of animal fur or skin patterns which undergo geometric
distortions due to body movement and posture changes. In this paper, we propose
a geometry-aware texture mapping approach that unwarps pelage patterns, the
unique markings found on an animal's skin or fur, into a canonical UV space,
enabling more robust feature matching. Our method uses surface normal
estimation to guide the unwrapping process while preserving the geometric
consistency between the 3D surface and the 2D texture space. We focus on two
challenging species: Saimaa ringed seals (Pusa hispida saimensis) and leopards
(Panthera pardus). Both species have distinctive yet highly deformable fur
patterns. By integrating our pattern-preserving UV mapping with existing
re-identification techniques, we demonstrate improved accuracy across diverse
poses and viewing angles. Our framework does not require ground truth UV
annotations and can be trained in a self-supervised manner. Experiments on seal
and leopard datasets show up to a 5.4% improvement in re-identification
accuracy.

TL;DR: DDIS是一种新的数据自由图像合成方法，利用扩散模型作为图像先验，通过领域对齐指导和类对齐令牌优化，生成更接近训练数据分布的图像。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开源预训练模型在训练数据不可用时效用下降，现有数据自由图像合成方法因缺乏自然图像先验知识导致生成样本偏离训练数据分布。

Method: 提出DDIS，结合扩散模型作为图像先验，引入领域对齐指导（DAG）和优化类对齐令牌（CAT）嵌入，以生成更准确的合成图像。

Result: 在PACS和ImageNet上的实验表明，DDIS优于现有方法，生成样本更接近训练数据分布，达到SOTA性能。

Conclusion: DDIS通过扩散模型和领域对齐指导，显著提升了数据自由图像合成的质量，为相关应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Open-source pre-trained models hold great potential for diverse applications,
but their utility declines when their training data is unavailable. Data-Free
Image Synthesis (DFIS) aims to generate images that approximate the learned
data distribution of a pre-trained model without accessing the original data.
However, existing DFIS meth ods produce samples that deviate from the training
data distribution due to the lack of prior knowl edge about natural images. To
overcome this limitation, we propose DDIS, the first Diffusion-assisted
Data-free Image Synthesis method that leverages a text-to-image diffusion model
as a powerful image prior, improving synthetic image quality. DDIS extracts
knowledge about the learned distribution from the given model and uses it to
guide the diffusion model, enabling the generation of images that accurately
align with the training data distribution. To achieve this, we introduce Domain
Alignment Guidance (DAG) that aligns the synthetic data domain with the
training data domain during the diffusion sampling process. Furthermore, we
optimize a single Class Alignment Token (CAT) embedding to effectively capture
class-specific attributes in the training dataset. Experiments on PACS and Ima
geNet demonstrate that DDIS outperforms prior DFIS methods by generating
samples that better reflect the training data distribution, achieving SOTA
performance in data-free applications.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为NERO的新型OOD评分机制，通过利用特征层的神经元级相关性来增强OOD检测能力，并在医学影像基准测试中验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在医学影像领域，确保深度学习模型的可靠性至关重要，尤其是识别分布外（OOD）样本的能力，因为OOD样本可能隐藏潜在异常。现有方法未能充分捕捉OOD多样性，因此需要一种更有效的解决方案。

Method: 提出NERO机制，通过聚类神经元级相关性形成类中心，并引入相关性距离度量样本与中心的偏差。结合特征范数和偏置项的缩放相关性，进一步优化性能。

Result: 在胃肠道影像基准测试（Kvasir和GastroVision）中，NERO优于现有OOD检测方法。

Conclusion: NERO通过神经元级相关性和新颖的距离度量，显著提升了OOD检测性能，同时支持可解释性。

Abstract: Ensuring reliability is paramount in deep learning, particularly within the
domain of medical imaging, where diagnostic decisions often hinge on model
outputs. The capacity to separate out-of-distribution (OOD) samples has proven
to be a valuable indicator of a model's reliability in research. In medical
imaging, this is especially critical, as identifying OOD inputs can help flag
potential anomalies that might otherwise go undetected. While many OOD
detection methods rely on feature or logit space representations, recent works
suggest these approaches may not fully capture OOD diversity. To address this,
we propose a novel OOD scoring mechanism, called NERO, that leverages
neuron-level relevance at the feature layer. Specifically, we cluster
neuron-level relevance for each in-distribution (ID) class to form
representative centroids and introduce a relevance distance metric to quantify
a new sample's deviation from these centroids, enhancing OOD separability.
Additionally, we refine performance by incorporating scaled relevance in the
bias term and combining feature norms. Our framework also enables explainable
OOD detection. We validate its effectiveness across multiple deep learning
architectures on the gastrointestinal imaging benchmarks Kvasir and
GastroVision, achieving improvements over state-of-the-art OOD detection
methods.

Motivation: 现有的大规模4D HOI数据集稀缺，限制了文本驱动的人-物交互合成的发展。

Result: 在OMOMO和3D-FUTURE数据集上取得最优结果，展示了对未见物体的强泛化能力和高质量4D HOI生成。

Conclusion: GenHOI框架有效解决了4D HOI合成的数据依赖问题，并提升了生成质量。

Abstract: While diffusion models and large-scale motion datasets have advanced
text-driven human motion synthesis, extending these advances to 4D human-object
interaction (HOI) remains challenging, mainly due to the limited availability
of large-scale 4D HOI datasets. In our study, we introduce GenHOI, a novel
two-stage framework aimed at achieving two key objectives: 1) generalization to
unseen objects and 2) the synthesis of high-fidelity 4D HOI sequences. In the
initial stage of our framework, we employ an Object-AnchorNet to reconstruct
sparse 3D HOI keyframes for unseen objects, learning solely from 3D HOI
datasets, thereby mitigating the dependence on large-scale 4D HOI datasets.
Subsequently, we introduce a Contact-Aware Diffusion Model (ContactDM) in the
second stage to seamlessly interpolate sparse 3D HOI keyframes into densely
temporally coherent 4D HOI sequences. To enhance the quality of generated 4D
HOI sequences, we propose a novel Contact-Aware Encoder within ContactDM to
extract human-object contact patterns and a novel Contact-Aware HOI Attention
to effectively integrate the contact signals into diffusion models.
Experimental results show that we achieve state-of-the-art results on the
publicly available OMOMO and 3D-FUTURE datasets, demonstrating strong
generalization abilities to unseen objects, while enabling high-fidelity 4D HOI
generation.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖密集LiDAR监督，成本高且数据需求大，RaCalNet旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 通过重新校准和细化稀疏雷达点构建深度先验，引导单目深度预测，避免密集监督。

Result: 在ZJU-4DRadarCam数据集上，RaCalNet的RMSE降低了35.30%和34.89%，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: RaCalNet证明了稀疏监督的可行性，显著提升了深度估计的精度和效率。

Abstract: Dense metric depth estimation using millimeter-wave radar typically requires
dense LiDAR supervision, generated via multi-frame projection and
interpolation, to guide the learning of accurate depth from sparse radar
measurements and RGB images. However, this paradigm is both costly and
data-intensive. To address this, we propose RaCalNet, a novel framework that
eliminates the need for dense supervision by using sparse LiDAR to supervise
the learning of refined radar measurements, resulting in a supervision density
of merely around 1% compared to dense-supervised methods. Unlike previous
approaches that associate radar points with broad image regions and rely
heavily on dense labels, RaCalNet first recalibrates and refines sparse radar
points to construct accurate depth priors. These priors then serve as reliable
anchors to guide monocular depth prediction, enabling metric-scale estimation
without resorting to dense supervision. This design improves structural
consistency and preserves fine details. Despite relying solely on sparse
supervision, RaCalNet surpasses state-of-the-art dense-supervised methods,
producing depth maps with clear object contours and fine-grained textures.
Extensive experiments on the ZJU-4DRadarCam dataset and real-world deployment
scenarios demonstrate its effectiveness, reducing RMSE by 35.30% and 34.89%,
respectively.

Motivation: 现有基于预训练文本到图像扩散模型的方法在布局控制上存在定位不准和伪影问题，WinWinLay旨在解决这些缺陷。

Method: 采用非局部注意力能量函数重新分配注意力分数，并使用基于Langevin动力学的自适应更新规则，以提升控制精度和图像真实性。

Result: 实验表明，WinWinLay在元素布局控制和视觉逼真度上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: WinWinLay通过理论分析和创新策略，显著提升了布局到图像生成的性能。

Abstract: Layout-to-Image generation aims to create complex scenes with precise control
over the placement and arrangement of subjects. Existing works have
demonstrated that pre-trained Text-to-Image diffusion models can achieve this
goal without training on any specific data; however, they often face challenges
with imprecise localization and unrealistic artifacts. Focusing on these
drawbacks, we propose a novel training-free method, WinWinLay. At its core,
WinWinLay presents two key strategies, Non-local Attention Energy Function and
Adaptive Update, that collaboratively enhance control precision and realism. On
one hand, we theoretically demonstrate that the commonly used attention energy
function introduces inherent spatial distribution biases, hindering objects
from being uniformly aligned with layout instructions. To overcome this issue,
non-local attention prior is explored to redistribute attention scores,
facilitating objects to better conform to the specified spatial conditions. On
the other hand, we identify that the vanilla backpropagation update rule can
cause deviations from the pre-trained domain, leading to out-of-distribution
artifacts. We accordingly introduce a Langevin dynamics-based adaptive update
scheme as a remedy that promotes in-domain updating while respecting layout
constraints. Extensive experiments demonstrate that WinWinLay excels in
controlling element placement and achieving photorealistic visual fidelity,
outperforming the current state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: 超高空间分辨率土地覆盖分类因像素级标注成本高、尺度变化大及大规模视觉模型适应性有限而具有挑战性。现有方法多依赖标注数据且适用于1米分辨率，而实际应用需在弱监督下处理更高分辨率图像。

Method: 提出了一种参数高效的半监督分割框架，结合SAM2知识并引入遥感专用FreqWeaver Adapter，以轻量化设计（仅5.96%参数）增强细粒度细节建模。

Result: 通过有效利用未标注数据并保持低参数开销，该方法在结构一致性上表现优异，比现有参数高效调优策略提升1.78%，比最先进高分辨率遥感分割方法提升3.44%。

Conclusion: 该方法在超高空间分辨率土地覆盖分类中表现出色，为弱监督下的高分辨率图像处理提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Ultra-high Spatial Resolution Land Cover Classification is essential for
fine-grained land cover analysis, yet it remains challenging due to the high
cost of pixel-level annotations, significant scale variation, and the limited
adaptability of large-scale vision models. Existing methods typically focus on
1-meter spatial resolution imagery and rely heavily on annotated data, whereas
practical applications often require processing higher-resolution imagery under
weak supervision. To address this, we propose a parameter-efficient
semi-supervised segmentation framework for 0.3 m spatial resolution imagery,
which leverages the knowledge of SAM2 and introduces a remote sensing-specific
FreqWeaver Adapter to enhance fine-grained detail modeling while maintaining a
lightweight design at only 5.96% of the total model parameters. By effectively
leveraging unlabeled data and maintaining minimal parameter overhead, the
proposed method delivers robust segmentation results with superior structural
consistency, achieving a 1.78% improvement over existing parameter-efficient
tuning strategies and a 3.44% gain compared to state-of-the-art high-resolution
remote sensing segmentation approaches.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种基于图的新型统一框架，用于大规模点云的端到端处理，显著提升了森林地上生物量（AGB）估计的效率和可扩展性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前定量结构模型（QSM）方法在估计AGB时存在局限性，如依赖高质量点云数据和多步预处理，限制了其实际应用。

Method: 通过创新的基于图的流程，无缝集成树木分割、叶木分离和3D骨架重建，利用路径和抽象等图操作进行树拓扑推理。

Result: 在多种条件下（如叶茂和叶落、不同空间尺度和数据源）验证，表现优异，尤其在叶茂场景（相对误差约20%）和低密度ULS数据（相对误差约30%）中。

Conclusion: 该框架为大规模、非破坏性AGB估计提供了稳健且可扩展的解决方案，减少了预处理依赖，并确立了ULS作为TLS的可行替代方案。

Abstract: Estimating forest above-ground biomass (AGB) is crucial for assessing carbon
storage and supporting sustainable forest management. Quantitative Structural
Model (QSM) offers a non-destructive approach to AGB estimation through 3D tree
structural reconstruction. However, current QSM methods face significant
limitations, as they are primarily designed for individual trees,depend on
high-quality point cloud data from terrestrial laser scanning (TLS), and also
require multiple pre-processing steps that hinder scalability and practical
deployment. This study presents a novel unified framework that enables
end-to-end processing of large-scale point clouds using an innovative
graph-based pipeline. The proposed approach seamlessly integrates tree
segmentation,leaf-wood separation and 3D skeletal reconstruction through
dedicated graph operations including pathing and abstracting for tree topology
reasoning. Comprehensive validation was conducted on datasets with varying leaf
conditions (leaf-on and leaf-off), spatial scales (tree- and plot-level), and
data sources (TLS and UAV-based laser scanning, ULS). Experimental results
demonstrate strong performance under challenging conditions, particularly in
leaf-on scenarios (~20% relative error) and low-density ULS datasets with
partial coverage (~30% relative error). These findings indicate that the
proposed framework provides a robust and scalable solution for large-scale,
non-destructive AGB estimation. It significantly reduces dependency on
specialized pre-processing tools and establishes ULS as a viable alternative to
TLS. To our knowledge, this is the first method capable of enabling seamless,
end-to-end 3D tree reconstruction at operational scales. This advancement
substantially improves the feasibility of QSM-based AGB estimation, paving the
way for broader applications in forest inventory and climate change research.

TL;DR: DLoRAL提出了一种双LoRA学习范式，通过跨帧检索和一致性学习，在保持时间一致性的同时增强视频超分辨率的空间细节。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于稳定扩散的Real-VSR方法在时间一致性和空间细节之间存在权衡，导致视觉质量不佳。

Method: 采用双LoRA学习范式，包括跨帧检索模块（CFR）和一致性-LoRA（C-LoRA）学习时间表示，再通过细节-LoRA（D-LoRA）增强空间细节。

Result: DLoRAL在精度和速度上均表现出色，实现了时间一致性和细节丰富的视频恢复。

Conclusion: DLoRAL通过双LoRA学习有效解决了Real-VSR中时间一致性与空间细节的平衡问题。

Abstract: It is a challenging problem to reproduce rich spatial details while
maintaining temporal consistency in real-world video super-resolution
(Real-VSR), especially when we leverage pre-trained generative models such as
stable diffusion (SD) for realistic details synthesis. Existing SD-based
Real-VSR methods often compromise spatial details for temporal coherence,
resulting in suboptimal visual quality. We argue that the key lies in how to
effectively extract the degradation-robust temporal consistency priors from the
low-quality (LQ) input video and enhance the video details while maintaining
the extracted consistency priors. To achieve this, we propose a Dual LoRA
Learning (DLoRAL) paradigm to train an effective SD-based one-step diffusion
model, achieving realistic frame details and temporal consistency
simultaneously. Specifically, we introduce a Cross-Frame Retrieval (CFR) module
to aggregate complementary information across frames, and train a
Consistency-LoRA (C-LoRA) to learn robust temporal representations from
degraded inputs. After consistency learning, we fix the CFR and C-LoRA modules
and train a Detail-LoRA (D-LoRA) to enhance spatial details while aligning with
the temporal space defined by C-LoRA to keep temporal coherence. The two phases
alternate iteratively for optimization, collaboratively delivering consistent
and detail-rich outputs. During inference, the two LoRA branches are merged
into the SD model, allowing efficient and high-quality video restoration in a
single diffusion step. Experiments show that DLoRAL achieves strong performance
in both accuracy and speed. Code and models are available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为M2M-Reg的新框架，用于解决多模态图像配准中因模态差异大导致的传统方法失效问题，通过单模态相似性训练模型，并引入GradCyCon正则化器提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床实践中，功能成像模态（如PET、FA）常需与结构参考（如MRI、CT）对齐，但传统无监督配准方法因模态差异大而难以学习可靠的空间映射，导致图像失真。

Method: 提出M2M-Reg框架，仅使用单模态相似性训练多模态配准模型，并引入GradCyCon正则化器促进微分同胚。框架还支持半监督学习，无需真实变换或分割掩码。

Result: 在ADNI数据集上，M2M-Reg在PET-MRI和FA-MRI配准中的DSC比现有方法高2倍，证明了其处理高度异质多模态配准的有效性。

Conclusion: M2M-Reg通过创新训练策略和正则化器，显著提升了多模态图像配准的性能，适用于临床实践中的复杂需求。

Abstract: In clinical practice, imaging modalities with functional characteristics,
such as positron emission tomography (PET) and fractional anisotropy (FA), are
often aligned with a structural reference (e.g., MRI, CT) for accurate
interpretation or group analysis, necessitating multi-modal deformable image
registration (DIR). However, due to the extreme heterogeneity of these
modalities compared to standard structural scans, conventional unsupervised DIR
methods struggle to learn reliable spatial mappings and often distort images.
We find that the similarity metrics guiding these models fail to capture
alignment between highly disparate modalities. To address this, we propose
M2M-Reg (Multi-to-Mono Registration), a novel framework that trains multi-modal
DIR models using only mono-modal similarity while preserving the established
architectural paradigm for seamless integration into existing models. We also
introduce GradCyCon, a regularizer that leverages M2M-Reg's cyclic training
scheme to promote diffeomorphism. Furthermore, our framework naturally extends
to a semi-supervised setting, integrating pre-aligned and unaligned pairs only,
without requiring ground-truth transformations or segmentation masks.
Experiments on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset
demonstrate that M2M-Reg achieves up to 2x higher DSC than prior methods for
PET-MRI and FA-MRI registration, highlighting its effectiveness in handling
highly heterogeneous multi-modal DIR. Our code is available at

Result: 在ScanNetV2和CA-1M数据集上达到SOTA性能，支持实时感知大范围场景。

Conclusion: 该框架无需重构，计算高效，泛化能力强，适用于实时3D物体检测。

Abstract: Open-vocabulary 3D object detection has gained significant interest due to
its critical applications in autonomous driving and embodied AI. Existing
detection methods, whether offline or online, typically rely on dense point
cloud reconstruction, which imposes substantial computational overhead and
memory constraints, hindering real-time deployment in downstream tasks. To
address this, we propose a novel reconstruction-free online framework tailored
for memory-efficient and real-time 3D detection. Specifically, given streaming
posed RGB-D video input, we leverage Cubify Anything as a pre-trained visual
foundation model (VFM) for single-view 3D object detection by bounding boxes,
coupled with CLIP to capture open-vocabulary semantics of detected objects. To
fuse all detected bounding boxes across different views into a unified one, we
employ an association module for correspondences of multi-views and an
optimization module to fuse the 3D bounding boxes of the same instance
predicted in multi-views. The association module utilizes 3D Non-Maximum
Suppression (NMS) and a box correspondence matching module, while the
optimization module uses an IoU-guided efficient random optimization technique
based on particle filtering to enforce multi-view consistency of the 3D
bounding boxes while minimizing computational complexity. Extensive experiments
on ScanNetV2 and CA-1M datasets demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance among online methods. Benefiting from this novel
reconstruction-free paradigm for 3D object detection, our method exhibits great
generalization abilities in various scenarios, enabling real-time perception
even in environments exceeding 1000 square meters.

Abstract: We present HOIDiNi, a text-driven diffusion framework for synthesizing
realistic and plausible human-object interaction (HOI). HOI generation is
extremely challenging since it induces strict contact accuracies alongside a
diverse motion manifold. While current literature trades off between realism
and physical correctness, HOIDiNi optimizes directly in the noise space of a
pretrained diffusion model using Diffusion Noise Optimization (DNO), achieving
both. This is made feasible thanks to our observation that the problem can be
separated into two phases: an object-centric phase, primarily making discrete
choices of hand-object contact locations, and a human-centric phase that
refines the full-body motion to realize this blueprint. This structured
approach allows for precise hand-object contact without compromising motion
naturalness. Quantitative, qualitative, and subjective evaluations on the GRAB
dataset alone clearly indicate HOIDiNi outperforms prior works and baselines in
contact accuracy, physical validity, and overall quality. Our results
demonstrate the ability to generate complex, controllable interactions,
including grasping, placing, and full-body coordination, driven solely by
textual prompts. https://hoidini.github.io.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型在处理长期记忆和大量图像数据时效率低下，限制了其在机器人控制任务中的应用。

Method: 在Habitat模拟器中引入了一个新的基准测试，包含60个需要长期记忆和情境感知的任务，并提出了结合导航策略的基线模型。

Result: 基准测试展示了模型在长期记忆任务中的表现，并指出了需要改进的领域。

Conclusion: 该工作为评估和改进视觉语言模型在长期记忆和推理任务中的能力提供了重要工具。

Abstract: Large vision-language models have recently demonstrated impressive
performance in planning and control tasks, driving interest in their
application to real-world robotics. However, deploying these models for
reasoning in embodied contexts is limited by their ability to incorporate
long-term experience collected across multiple days and represented by vast
collections of images. Current VLMs typically struggle to process more than a
few hundred images concurrently, highlighting the need for more efficient
mechanisms to handle long-term memory in embodied settings. To effectively
evaluate these models for long-horizon control, a benchmark must specifically
target scenarios where memory is crucial for success. Existing long-video QA
benchmarks overlook embodied challenges like object manipulation and
navigation, which demand low-level skills and fine-grained reasoning over past
interactions. Moreover, effective memory integration in embodied agents
involves both recalling relevant historical information and executing actions
based on that information, making it essential to study these aspects together
rather than in isolation. In this work, we introduce a new benchmark for
long-range embodied tasks in the Habitat simulator. This benchmark evaluates
memory-based capabilities across 60 tasks requiring sustained engagement and
contextual awareness in an environment. The tasks can also be procedurally
extended to longer and more challenging versions, enabling scalable evaluation
of memory and reasoning. We also present baselines that integrate
state-of-the-art VLMs with low level navigation policies, assessing their
performance on these memory-intensive tasks and highlight areas for
improvement.

TL;DR: 研究发现，多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在视觉质量与任务表现之间存在矛盾，即图像质量偏离人类感知时性能可能提升。为此，作者提出了一种轻量级适配模块VQ-TTT，动态调整输入图像以提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨视觉输入质量对MLLMs性能的影响，揭示其与人类感知的差异，并提出解决方案。

Method: 通过控制图像质量退化与风格变化进行实验，提出VQ-TTT模块，动态调整输入图像频率内容。

Result: VQ-TTT显著提升了MLLMs在所有数据集上的平均准确率，无需额外数据或模型。

Conclusion: 研究重新定义了MLLMs的“更好”视觉输入，强调需要自适应而非普遍“干净”的图像。

Abstract: Recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel on benchmark
vision-language tasks, yet little is known about how input visual quality
shapes their responses. Does higher perceptual quality of images already
translate to better MLLM understanding? We conduct the first systematic study
spanning leading MLLMs and a suite of vision-language benchmarks, applying
controlled degradations and stylistic shifts to each image. Surprisingly, we
uncover a visual-quality paradox: model, task, and even individual-instance
performance can improve when images deviate from human-perceived fidelity.
Off-the-shelf restoration pipelines fail to reconcile these idiosyncratic
preferences. To close the gap, we introduce Visual-Quality Test-Time Tuning
(VQ-TTT)-a lightweight adaptation module that: (1) inserts a learnable,
low-rank kernel before the frozen vision encoder to modulate frequency content;
and (2) fine-tunes only shallow vision-encoder layers via LoRA. VQ-TTT
dynamically adjusts each input image in a single forward pass, aligning it with
task-specific model preferences. Across the evaluated MLLMs and all datasets,
VQ-TTT lifts significant average accuracy, with no external models, cached
features, or extra training data. These findings redefine ``better'' visual
inputs for MLLMs and highlight the need for adaptive, rather than universally
``clean'', imagery, in the new era of AI being the main data customer.

TL;DR: ViMaR是一种两阶段推理框架，通过结合时间差分价值模型和边缘感知奖励调整，显著提升了视觉语言模型的推理效率和输出质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在推理时搜索方法上存在计算成本高和低置信度生成导致幻觉的问题，ViMaR旨在解决这些问题。

Method: ViMaR分为两阶段：首阶段通过单次推理选出最佳候选描述；次阶段选择性优化低视觉基础部分，并通过边缘惩罚抑制低置信度生成。

Result: 实验表明ViMaR生成的描述更可靠、准确且详细，速度提升4倍以上，并能跨模型泛化指导解码。

Conclusion: ViMaR是一种高效、可扩展的推理策略，能显著提升视觉语言模型的性能和自训练效果。

Abstract: Despite significant advances in inference-time search for vision-language
models (VLMs), existing approaches remain both computationally expensive and
prone to unpenalized, low-confidence generations which often lead to persistent
hallucinations. We introduce \textbf{Value-guided Inference with Margin-based
Reward (ViMaR)}, a two-stage inference framework that improves both efficiency
and output fidelity by combining a temporal-difference value model with a
margin-aware reward adjustment. In the first stage, we perform a single pass to
identify the highest-value caption among diverse candidates. In the second
stage, we selectively refine only those segments that were overlooked or
exhibit weak visual grounding, thereby eliminating frequently rewarded
evaluations. A calibrated margin-based penalty discourages low-confidence
continuations while preserving descriptive richness. Extensive experiments
across multiple VLM architectures demonstrate that ViMaR generates captions
that are significantly more reliable, factually accurate, detailed, and
explanatory, while achieving over 4$\times$ speedup compared to existing
value-guided methods. Specifically, we show that ViMaR trained solely on LLaVA
Mistral-7B, \textit{generalizes effectively to guide decoding in a stronger
unseen model}. To further validate this, we adapt the ViMaR to steer generation
in LLaVA-OneVision-Qwen2-7B, leading to consistent improvements in caption
quality and demonstrating robust cross-model guidance. This cross-model
generalization highlights ViMaR's flexibility and modularity, positioning it as
a scalable and transferable inference-time decoding strategy. Furthermore, when
ViMaR-generated captions are used for self-training, the underlying models
achieve substantial gains across a broad suite of visual comprehension
benchmarks, underscoring the potential of fast, accurate, and self-improving
VLM pipelines.

Conclusion: 该方法通过联合优化提升了场景理解和光照效果生成能力，为单图像或视频重光照提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: We address the challenge of relighting a single image or video, a task that
demands precise scene intrinsic understanding and high-quality light transport
synthesis. Existing end-to-end relighting models are often limited by the
scarcity of paired multi-illumination data, restricting their ability to
generalize across diverse scenes. Conversely, two-stage pipelines that combine
inverse and forward rendering can mitigate data requirements but are
susceptible to error accumulation and often fail to produce realistic outputs
under complex lighting conditions or with sophisticated materials. In this
work, we introduce a general-purpose approach that jointly estimates albedo and
synthesizes relit outputs in a single pass, harnessing the generative
capabilities of video diffusion models. This joint formulation enhances
implicit scene comprehension and facilitates the creation of realistic lighting
effects and intricate material interactions, such as shadows, reflections, and
transparency. Trained on synthetic multi-illumination data and extensive
automatically labeled real-world videos, our model demonstrates strong
generalization across diverse domains and surpasses previous methods in both
visual fidelity and temporal consistency.

Abstract: Video generation techniques have made remarkable progress, promising to be
the foundation of interactive world exploration. However, existing video
generation datasets are not well-suited for world exploration training as they
suffer from some limitations: limited locations, short duration, static scenes,
and a lack of annotations about exploration and the world. In this paper, we
introduce Sekai (meaning ``world'' in Japanese), a high-quality first-person
view worldwide video dataset with rich annotations for world exploration. It
consists of over 5,000 hours of walking or drone view (FPV and UVA) videos from
over 100 countries and regions across 750 cities. We develop an efficient and
effective toolbox to collect, pre-process and annotate videos with location,
scene, weather, crowd density, captions, and camera trajectories. Experiments
demonstrate the quality of the dataset. And, we use a subset to train an
interactive video world exploration model, named YUME (meaning ``dream'' in
Japanese). We believe Sekai will benefit the area of video generation and world
exploration, and motivate valuable applications.

Motivation: 扩散模型推理速度慢且计算成本高，现有方法依赖固定启发式规则，效果有限。

Method: 提出ECAD，利用遗传算法学习高效的、针对特定模型的缓存调度策略，无需修改网络参数或参考图像。

Result: 在多个模型和基准测试中，ECAD显著提升推理速度（如PixArt-alpha加速2.58倍）并改善生成质量（如COCO FID提升4.47）。

Conclusion: ECAD是一种可扩展且通用的扩散模型加速方法，适用于不同模型和分辨率。

Abstract: Diffusion-based image generation models excel at producing high-quality
synthetic content, but suffer from slow and computationally expensive
inference. Prior work has attempted to mitigate this by caching and reusing
features within diffusion transformers across inference steps. These methods,
however, often rely on rigid heuristics that result in limited acceleration or
poor generalization across architectures. We propose Evolutionary Caching to
Accelerate Diffusion models (ECAD), a genetic algorithm that learns efficient,
per-model, caching schedules forming a Pareto frontier, using only a small set
of calibration prompts. ECAD requires no modifications to network parameters or
reference images. It offers significant inference speedups, enables
fine-grained control over the quality-latency trade-off, and adapts seamlessly
to different diffusion models. Notably, ECAD's learned schedules can generalize
effectively to resolutions and model variants not seen during calibration. We
evaluate ECAD on PixArt-alpha, PixArt-Sigma, and FLUX-1.dev using multiple
metrics (FID, CLIP, Image Reward) across diverse benchmarks (COCO, MJHQ-30k,
PartiPrompts), demonstrating consistent improvements over previous approaches.
On PixArt-alpha, ECAD identifies a schedule that outperforms the previous
state-of-the-art method by 4.47 COCO FID while increasing inference speedup
from 2.35x to 2.58x. Our results establish ECAD as a scalable and generalizable
approach for accelerating diffusion inference. Our project website is available

Conclusion: EffVR为可持续移动VR提供高效解决方案。

Abstract: Mobile Virtual Reality (VR) is essential to achieving convenient and
immersive human-computer interaction and realizing emerging applications such
as Metaverse. However, existing VR technologies require two separate renderings
of binocular images, causing a significant bottleneck for mobile devices with
limited computing capability and power supply. This paper proposes an approach
to rendering optimization for mobile VR called EffVR. By utilizing the
per-pixel attribute, EffVR can generate binocular VR images from the monocular
image through genuinely one rendering, saving half the computation over
conventional approaches. Our evaluation indicates that, compared with the
state-of-art, EffVRcan save 27% power consumption on average while achieving
high binocular image quality (0.9679 SSIM and 34.09 PSNR) in mobile VR
applications. Additionally, EffVR can increase the frame rate by 115.2%. These
results corroborate EffVRsuperior computation/energy-saving performance, paving
the road to a sustainable mobile VR. The source code, demo video, android app,

Motivation: 现有方法假设IMU传感器紧密附着于人体，但现实中常不成立，因此研究松散附着IMU的姿态估计更具实用性。

Method: 模拟松散IMU数据，开发基于Transformer的扩散模型合成数据并估计姿态，结合服装参数优化训练。

Result: 在模拟和合成数据上训练的扩散模型在定量和定性上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法为松散IMU姿态估计提供了新方向，结合服装参数能有效提升性能。

Abstract: Motion capture using sparse inertial sensors has shown great promise due to
its portability and lack of occlusion issues compared to camera-based tracking.
Existing approaches typically assume that IMU sensors are tightly attached to
the human body. However, this assumption often does not hold in real-world
scenarios. In this paper, we present a new task of full-body human pose
estimation using sparse, loosely attached IMU sensors. To solve this task, we
simulate IMU recordings from an existing garment-aware human motion dataset. We
developed transformer-based diffusion models to synthesize loose IMU data and
estimate human poses based on this challenging loose IMU data. In addition, we
show that incorporating garment-related parameters while training the model on
simulated loose data effectively maintains expressiveness and enhances the
ability to capture variations introduced by looser or tighter garments.
Experiments show that our proposed diffusion methods trained on simulated and
synthetic data outperformed the state-of-the-art methods quantitatively and
qualitatively, opening up a promising direction for future research.

Abstract: Face sketch synthesis is a technique aimed at converting face photos into
sketches. Existing face sketch synthesis research mainly relies on training
with numerous photo-sketch sample pairs from existing datasets. However, these
large-scale discriminative learning methods will have to face problems such as
data scarcity and high human labor costs. Once the training data becomes
scarce, their generative performance significantly degrades. In this paper, we
propose a one-shot face sketch synthesis method based on diffusion models. We
optimize text instructions on a diffusion model using face photo-sketch image
pairs. Then, the instructions derived through gradient-based optimization are
used for inference. To simulate real-world scenarios more accurately and
evaluate method effectiveness more comprehensively, we introduce a new
benchmark named One-shot Face Sketch Dataset (OS-Sketch). The benchmark
consists of 400 pairs of face photo-sketch images, including sketches with
different styles and photos with different backgrounds, ages, sexes,
expressions, illumination, etc. For a solid out-of-distribution evaluation, we
select only one pair of images for training at each time, with the rest used
for inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can
convert various photos into realistic and highly consistent sketches in a
one-shot context. Compared to other methods, our approach offers greater
convenience and broader applicability. The dataset will be available at:

Motivation: 现有3D生成模型（如扩散模型）在遵循指令、对齐人类偏好及生成逼真纹理、几何和物理属性方面存在不足。

Method: 基于Nabla-GFlowNet方法，通过匹配奖励梯度进行奖励微调，提出Nabla-R2D3框架，利用2D奖励信号优化3D扩散模型。

Result: 实验表明，Nabla-R2D3在少量微调步骤内即可获得更高奖励并减少先验遗忘，优于传统微调基线。

Conclusion: Nabla-R2D3为3D生成模型提供了一种高效且样本利用率高的对齐方法。

Abstract: Generating high-quality and photorealistic 3D assets remains a longstanding
challenge in 3D vision and computer graphics. Although state-of-the-art
generative models, such as diffusion models, have made significant progress in
3D generation, they often fall short of human-designed content due to limited
ability to follow instructions, align with human preferences, or produce
realistic textures, geometries, and physical attributes. In this paper, we
introduce Nabla-R2D3, a highly effective and sample-efficient reinforcement
learning alignment framework for 3D-native diffusion models using 2D rewards.
Built upon the recently proposed Nabla-GFlowNet method, which matches the score
function to reward gradients in a principled manner for reward finetuning, our
Nabla-R2D3 enables effective adaptation of 3D diffusion models using only 2D
reward signals. Extensive experiments show that, unlike vanilla finetuning
baselines which either struggle to converge or suffer from reward hacking,
Nabla-R2D3 consistently achieves higher rewards and reduced prior forgetting
within a few finetuning steps.

Abstract: In this work, we present a manually annotated corpus for Adverse Event (AE)
extraction from discharge summaries of elderly patients, a population often
underrepresented in clinical NLP resources. The dataset includes 14 clinically
significant AEs-such as falls, delirium, and intracranial haemorrhage, along
with contextual attributes like negation, diagnosis type, and in-hospital
occurrence. Uniquely, the annotation schema supports both discontinuous and
overlapping entities, addressing challenges rarely tackled in prior work. We
evaluate multiple models using FlairNLP across three annotation granularities:
fine-grained, coarse-grained, and coarse-grained with negation. While
transformer-based models (e.g., BERT-cased) achieve strong performance on
document-level coarse-grained extraction (F1 = 0.943), performance drops
notably for fine-grained entity-level tasks (e.g., F1 = 0.675), particularly
for rare events and complex attributes. These results demonstrate that despite
high-level scores, significant challenges remain in detecting underrepresented
AEs and capturing nuanced clinical language. Developed within a Trusted
Research Environment (TRE), the dataset is available upon request via DataLoch
and serves as a robust benchmark for evaluating AE extraction methods and

Motivation: 现有方法在训练时无需模型了解约束条件，但在测试时可能导致低质量输出。BoostCD旨在解决这一问题。

Method: BoostCD分两阶段：第一阶段分别进行约束和无约束解码生成弱预测；第二阶段通过学习模型结合两者生成最终预测。

Result: 应用于封闭信息提取任务时，BoostCD方法（BoostIE）在分布内外均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: BoostCD通过利用约束和无约束解码的互补性，显著提升了结构化NLP任务的性能。

Abstract: Many recent approaches to structured NLP tasks use an autoregressive language
model $M$ to map unstructured input text $x$ to output text $y$ representing
structured objects (such as tuples, lists, trees, code, etc.), where the
desired output structure is enforced via constrained decoding. During training,
these approaches do not require the model to be aware of the constraints, which
are merely implicit in the training outputs $y$. This is advantageous as it
allows for dynamic constraints without requiring retraining, but can lead to
low-quality output during constrained decoding at test time. We overcome this
problem with Boosted Constrained Decoding (BoostCD), which combines constrained
and unconstrained decoding in two phases: Phase 1 decodes from the base model
$M$ twice, in constrained and unconstrained mode, obtaining two weak
predictions. In phase 2, a learned autoregressive boosted model combines the
two weak predictions into one final prediction. The mistakes made by the base
model with vs. without constraints tend to be complementary, which the boosted
model learns to exploit for improved performance. We demonstrate the power of
BoostCD by applying it to closed information extraction. Our model, BoostIE,
outperforms prior approaches both in and out of distribution, addressing
several common errors identified in those approaches.

Abstract: The integration of contextual information has significantly enhanced the
performance of large language models (LLMs) on knowledge-intensive tasks.
However, existing methods often overlook a critical challenge: the credibility
of context documents can vary widely, potentially leading to the propagation of
unreliable information. In this paper, we introduce CrEst, a novel weakly
supervised framework for assessing the credibility of context documents during
LLM inference--without requiring manual annotations. Our approach is grounded
in the insight that credible documents tend to exhibit higher semantic
coherence with other credible documents, enabling automated credibility
estimation through inter-document agreement. To incorporate credibility into
LLM inference, we propose two integration strategies: a black-box approach for
models without access to internal weights or activations, and a white-box
method that directly modifies attention mechanisms. Extensive experiments
across three model architectures and five datasets demonstrate that CrEst
consistently outperforms strong baselines, achieving up to a 26.86% improvement
in accuracy and a 3.49% increase in F1 score. Further analysis shows that CrEst
maintains robust performance even under high-noise conditions.

longer-context inputs, few benchmarks exist to rigorously examine model
behavior in this setting. Moreover, the multi-document setting is historically
challenging for benchmark creation due to the expensive cost of annotating long
inputs. In this work, we introduce MDBench, a new dataset for evaluating LLMs
on the task of multi-document reasoning. Notably, MDBench is created through a
novel synthetic generation process, allowing us to controllably and efficiently
generate challenging document sets and the corresponding question-answer (QA)
examples. Our novel technique operates on condensed structured seed knowledge,
modifying it through LLM-assisted edits to induce MD-specific reasoning
challenges. We then convert this structured knowledge into a natural text
surface form, generating a document set and corresponding QA example. We
analyze the behavior of popular LLMs and prompting techniques, finding that
MDBENCH poses significant challenges for all methods, even with relatively
short document sets. We also see our knowledge-guided generation technique (1)
allows us to readily perform targeted analysis of MD-specific reasoning
capabilities and (2) can be adapted quickly to account for new challenges and
future modeling improvements.

### [72] [From Chat to Checkup: Can Large Language Models Assist in Diabetes Prediction?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14949)
*Shadman Sakib,Oishy Fatema Akhand,Ajwad Abrar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）在糖尿病预测中的有效性，比较了零样本、单样本和三样本提示方法，发现专有LLMs表现优于开源模型，但需进一步优化提示策略和领域微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLMs在结构化数值数据（如糖尿病预测）中的应用潜力，填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 使用Pima Indian Diabetes Database（PIDD），评估六种LLMs（包括开源和专有模型）及三种传统机器学习模型，采用准确率、精确率、召回率和F1分数作为评估指标。

Result: 专有LLMs（如GPT-4o和Gemma-2-27B）在少样本设置中表现最佳，Gemma-2-27B的F1分数甚至超过传统机器学习模型。

Conclusion: LLMs在医疗预测任务中具有潜力，未来需优化提示工程和混合方法以提升性能。

Abstract: While Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) models have been widely
used for diabetes prediction, the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for
structured numerical data is still not well explored. In this study, we test
the effectiveness of LLMs in predicting diabetes using zero-shot, one-shot, and
three-shot prompting methods. We conduct an empirical analysis using the Pima
Indian Diabetes Database (PIDD). We evaluate six LLMs, including four
open-source models: Gemma-2-27B, Mistral-7B, Llama-3.1-8B, and Llama-3.2-2B. We
also test two proprietary models: GPT-4o and Gemini Flash 2.0. In addition, we
compare their performance with three traditional machine learning models:
Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machine (SVM). We use
accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score as evaluation metrics. Our results
show that proprietary LLMs perform better than open-source ones, with GPT-4o
and Gemma-2-27B achieving the highest accuracy in few-shot settings. Notably,
Gemma-2-27B also outperforms the traditional ML models in terms of F1-score.
However, there are still issues such as performance variation across prompting
strategies and the need for domain-specific fine-tuning. This study shows that
LLMs can be useful for medical prediction tasks and encourages future work on
prompt engineering and hybrid approaches to improve healthcare predictions.

TL;DR: 研究发现，通过引入特殊记忆令牌，可以生成可逆的句子嵌入，使LLM在不修改模型权重的情况下精确重建原始文本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLM是否能够在不改变权重的情况下精确重建原始文本，并研究其潜在应用。

Method: 通过训练优化特殊记忆令牌的嵌入，使其能够提示模型重建固定序列。

Result: 在英语和西班牙语数据集上，模型（包括Llama 3.1 8B）成功重建了长达240个令牌的序列。

Conclusion: 这一现象展示了LLM的有趣能力，为记忆检索、压缩和可控文本生成提供了潜在应用。

Abstract: In this work, we observe an interesting phenomenon: it is possible to
generate reversible sentence embeddings that allow an LLM to reconstruct the
original text exactly, without modifying the model's weights. This is achieved
by introducing a special memory token, whose embedding is optimized through
training on a fixed sequence. When prompted with this embedding, the model
reconstructs the fixed sequence exactly. We evaluate this phenomenon across
English and Spanish datasets, sequences of up to approximately 240 tokens, and
model scales ranging from 100M to 8B parameters. Notably, Llama 3.1 8B
successfully reconstructs all tested sequences. Our findings highlight an
interesting capability of LLMs and suggest potential applications in
memory-based retrieval, compression, and controlled text generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社会隔离和孤独感近年增加，与自杀率密切相关，但未被美国国家暴力死亡报告系统记录，需通过技术手段识别。

Method: 使用主题建模生成词典，并结合监督学习分类器，分析2002至2020年30万例自杀数据。

Result: 分类器表现优异（F1: 0.86，准确率: 0.82），识别出1,198例慢性社会隔离案例，男性、同性恋或离婚者风险更高。

Conclusion: 该方法可改善美国社会隔离和孤独感的监测与预防。

Abstract: Social isolation and loneliness, which have been increasing in recent years
strongly contribute toward suicide rates. Although social isolation and
loneliness are not currently recorded within the US National Violent Death
Reporting System's (NVDRS) structured variables, natural language processing
(NLP) techniques can be used to identify these constructs in law enforcement
and coroner medical examiner narratives. Using topic modeling to generate
lexicon development and supervised learning classifiers, we developed
high-quality classifiers (average F1: .86, accuracy: .82). Evaluating over
300,000 suicides from 2002 to 2020, we identified 1,198 mentioning chronic
social isolation. Decedents had higher odds of chronic social isolation
classification if they were men (OR = 1.44; CI: 1.24, 1.69, p<.0001), gay (OR =
3.68; 1.97, 6.33, p<.0001), or were divorced (OR = 3.34; 2.68, 4.19, p<.0001).
We found significant predictors for other social isolation topics of recent or
impending divorce, child custody loss, eviction or recent move, and break-up.
Our methods can improve surveillance and prevention of social isolation and
loneliness in the United States.

TL;DR: PrefBERT是一种用于评估开放式生成长文本的评分模型，通过提供比传统指标更优的语义奖励反馈，支持GRPO训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在评估开放式长文本生成时，常忽略关键方面（如连贯性、风格或相关性）或受预训练数据偏见影响，导致评估不足。

Method: 提出PrefBERT，基于多样长文本风格和质量评分的响应评估数据集训练，为GRPO提供语义奖励反馈。

Result: PrefBERT在多句子和段落长度响应上表现可靠，与传统指标相比，更符合人类偏好。

Conclusion: PrefBERT作为奖励信号训练策略模型，生成的响应更符合人类偏好，优于传统指标。

Abstract: Evaluating open-ended long-form generation is challenging because it is hard
to define what clearly separates good from bad outputs. Existing methods often
miss key aspects like coherence, style, or relevance, or are biased by
pretraining data, making open-ended long-form evaluation an underexplored
problem. To address this gap, we propose PrefBERT, a scoring model for
evaluating open-ended long-form generation in GRPO and guiding its training
with distinct rewards for good and bad outputs. Trained on two response
evaluation datasets with diverse long-form styles and Likert-rated quality,
PrefBERT effectively supports GRPO by offering better semantic reward feedback
than traditional metrics ROUGE-L and BERTScore do. Through comprehensive
evaluations, including LLM-as-a-judge, human ratings, and qualitative analysis,
we show that PrefBERT, trained on multi-sentence and paragraph-length
responses, remains reliable across varied long passages and aligns well with
the verifiable rewards GRPO needs. Human evaluations confirm that using
PrefBERT as the reward signal to train policy models yields responses better
aligned with human preferences than those trained with traditional metrics. Our
code is available at https://github.com/zli12321/long_form_rl.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了学习阶段知识编码对大型语言模型（LLM）事后遗忘特定知识的影响，发现使用转述描述学习可提升遗忘效果，但遗忘文本块中的单个知识仍具挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM在现实中的广泛应用，事后遗忘特定知识的需求日益增长，涉及隐私法规和内容更新等问题。

Method: 通过实验研究学习阶段知识编码对遗忘效果的影响，重点关注转述描述和文本块中的知识遗忘。

Result: 发现转述描述学习能提升遗忘性能，但遗忘文本块中的单个知识较困难。

Conclusion: 学习阶段的知识编码对实现可靠的事后遗忘具有重要作用。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in the real world,
the ability to ``unlearn'', or remove specific pieces of knowledge post hoc,
has become essential for a variety of reasons ranging from privacy regulations
to correcting outdated or harmful content. Prior work has proposed unlearning
benchmarks and algorithms, and has typically assumed that the training process
and the target model are fixed. In this work, we empirically investigate how
learning-time choices in knowledge encoding impact the effectiveness of
unlearning factual knowledge. Our experiments reveal two key findings: (1)
learning with paraphrased descriptions improves unlearning performance and (2)
unlearning individual piece of knowledge from a chunk of text is challenging.
Our results suggest that learning-time knowledge encoding may play a central
role in enabling reliable post-hoc unlearning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对话中的语言特征（如省略和习语）常导致话语关系模糊，增加了解析难度，因此需要一种新方法来应对这些挑战。

Method: 提出DCM模块，包含澄清类型推理和话语目标推理，并结合CPO优化澄清过程以减少错误。

Result: 在STAC和Molweni数据集上的实验表明，该方法有效解决了歧义问题，性能显著优于现有基线。

Conclusion: DCM和CPO的结合显著提升了对话话语解析的准确性和鲁棒性，为解决歧义问题提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Dialogue discourse parsing aims to identify and analyze discourse relations
between the utterances within dialogues. However, linguistic features in
dialogues, such as omission and idiom, frequently introduce ambiguities that
obscure the intended discourse relations, posing significant challenges for
parsers. To address this issue, we propose a Discourse-aware Clarification
Module (DCM) to enhance the performance of the dialogue discourse parser. DCM
employs two distinct reasoning processes: clarification type reasoning and
discourse goal reasoning. The former analyzes linguistic features, while the
latter distinguishes the intended relation from the ambiguous one. Furthermore,
we introduce Contribution-aware Preference Optimization (CPO) to mitigate the
risk of erroneous clarifications, thereby reducing cascading errors. CPO
enables the parser to assess the contributions of the clarifications from DCM
and provide feedback to optimize the DCM, enhancing its adaptability and
alignment with the parser's requirements. Extensive experiments on the STAC and
Molweni datasets demonstrate that our approach effectively resolves ambiguities
and significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于EHR的疾病预测模型在医学知识表示和临床部署效率方面存在不足，限制了其实际应用。

Method: 研究采用知识蒸馏技术，首先对大型语言模型Qwen2.5-7B进行医学知识增强的微调作为教师模型，然后通过多粒度注意力蒸馏机制生成可解释的软标签，最后将知识迁移到轻量级BERT学生模型中。

Result: 在MIMIC-III数据集上，CKD-EHR显著优于基线模型：诊断准确率提高9%，F1分数提升27%，推理速度加快22.2倍。

Conclusion: CKD-EHR不仅提高了资源利用效率，还显著提升了诊断的准确性和及时性，为临床资源优化提供了实用技术方案。

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHR)-based disease prediction models have
demonstrated significant clinical value in promoting precision medicine and
enabling early intervention. However, existing large language models face two
major challenges: insufficient representation of medical knowledge and low
efficiency in clinical deployment. To address these challenges, this study
proposes the CKD-EHR (Clinical Knowledge Distillation for EHR) framework, which
achieves efficient and accurate disease risk prediction through knowledge
distillation techniques. Specifically, the large language model Qwen2.5-7B is
first fine-tuned on medical knowledge-enhanced data to serve as the teacher
model.It then generates interpretable soft labels through a multi-granularity
attention distillation mechanism. Finally, the distilled knowledge is
transferred to a lightweight BERT student model. Experimental results show that
on the MIMIC-III dataset, CKD-EHR significantly outperforms the baseline
model:diagnostic accuracy is increased by 9%, F1-score is improved by 27%, and
a 22.2 times inference speedup is achieved. This innovative solution not only
greatly improves resource utilization efficiency but also significantly
enhances the accuracy and timeliness of diagnosis, providing a practical
technical approach for resource optimization in clinical settings. The code and
data for this research are available athttps://github.com/209506702/CKD_EHR.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种两阶段框架（MRG和PS），通过分解开放域对话生成任务，利用新数据集o2mDial提升小模型在多样性和质量上的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开放域对话具有一对多特性，现有LLM对话代理未充分利用此特性提升多样性。

Method: 将对话生成分解为多响应生成（MRG）和偏好选择（PS），并引入o2mDial数据集及新学习策略和评估指标。

Result: 应用两阶段框架后，小模型的响应多样性提升，质量提高90%，接近大模型表现。

Conclusion: 通过显式建模一对多特性，小模型在开放域对话中能显著提升性能。

Abstract: Open-domain Dialogue (OD) exhibits a one-to-many (o2m) property, whereby
multiple appropriate responses exist for a single dialogue context. Despite
prior research showing that modeling this property boosts response diversity,
most modern LLM-based dialogue agents do not explicitly do so. In this work, we
model the o2m property of OD in LLMs by decomposing OD generation into two key
tasks: Multi-Response Generation (MRG) and Preference-based Selection (PS),
which entail generating a set of n semantically and lexically diverse
high-quality responses for a given dialogue context, followed by selecting a
single response based on human preference, respectively. To facilitate MRG and
PS, we introduce o2mDial, a dialogue corpus explicitly designed to capture the
o2m property by featuring multiple plausible responses for each context.
Leveraging o2mDial, we propose new in-context learning and instruction-tuning
strategies, as well as novel evaluation metrics for MRG, alongside a
model-based approach for PS. Empirical results demonstrate that applying the
proposed two-stage framework to smaller LLMs for OD generation enhances overall
response diversity while maintaining contextual coherence, improving response
quality by up to 90%, bringing them closer to the performance of larger models.

Motivation: 设计一种高效的分词器，减少分词数量（降低fertility）而不影响模型性能，以适应韩语的语言结构。

Method: 采用基于规则的预分词方法，结合种子词汇和分支熵选择算法，增加平均分词长度。

Result: 实验显示，Thunder-Tok比BPE减少10%的分词数量，提升推理速度10%，且不影响下游任务性能。

Conclusion: 基于语言学的分词方法对设计高效分词器是有效且实用的。

Abstract: This paper introduces Thunder-Tok, a new Korean tokenizer designed to reduce
token fertility without compromising model performance. Our approach uses a
rule-based pre-tokenization method that aligns with the linguistic structure of
the Korean language. We also create a seed vocabulary containing tokens that
resemble linguistic units and employ a branching entropy-based selection
algorithm. These techniques increase the average token length, thus lowering
fertility while preserving linguistic information. Experimental results
indicate that Thunder-Tok reduces fertility by approximately 10% (i.e., reduces
the number of tokens by 10%, improving the inference speed by 10%) compared to
BPE without compromising performance across various downstream tasks. These
findings demonstrate that our linguistically informed approach is effective and
practical for designing efficient tokenizers for language models.

Motivation: 探索语言模型中信息的保留和遗忘机制，以理解其记忆行为。

Method: 在Mamba架构中应用结构化回忆任务，分析U形准确率曲线，识别三种记忆机制。

Result: 发现长期记忆由稀疏通道支持，短期记忆受delta调制递归影响，记忆分配受语义规律动态调节。

Conclusion: 验证了Mamba模型中记忆机制的三种核心驱动因素，为理解其行为提供了新视角。

Abstract: We study memory in state-space language models using primacy and recency
effects as behavioral tools to uncover how information is retained and
forgotten over time. Applying structured recall tasks to the Mamba
architecture, we observe a consistent U-shaped accuracy profile, indicating
strong performance at the beginning and end of input sequences. We identify
three mechanisms that give rise to this pattern. First, long-term memory is
supported by a sparse subset of channels within the model's selective state
space block, which persistently encode early input tokens and are causally
linked to primacy effects. Second, short-term memory is governed by
delta-modulated recurrence: recent inputs receive more weight due to
exponential decay, but this recency advantage collapses when distractor items
are introduced, revealing a clear limit to memory depth. Third, we find that
memory allocation is dynamically modulated by semantic regularity: repeated
relations in the input sequence shift the delta gating behavior, increasing the
tendency to forget intermediate items. We validate these findings via targeted
ablations and input perturbations on two large-scale Mamba-based language
models: one with 1.4B and another with 7B parameters.

Abstract: In 2012, the United Nations introduced 17 Sustainable Development Goals
(SDGs) aimed at creating a more sustainable and improved future by 2030.
However, tracking progress toward these goals is difficult because of the
extensive scale and complexity of the data involved. Text classification models
have become vital tools in this area, automating the analysis of vast amounts
of text from a variety of sources. Additionally, large language models (LLMs)
have recently proven indispensable for many natural language processing tasks,
including text classification, thanks to their ability to recognize complex
linguistic patterns and semantics. This study analyzes various proprietary and
open-source LLMs for a single-label, multi-class text classification task
focused on the SDGs. Then, it also evaluates the effectiveness of task
adaptation techniques (i.e., in-context learning approaches), namely Zero-Shot
and Few-Shot Learning, as well as Fine-Tuning within this domain. The results
reveal that smaller models, when optimized through prompt engineering, can
perform on par with larger models like OpenAI's GPT (Generative Pre-trained

Conclusion: 抽象推理原型是大型语言模型可泛化推理的基础，ProtoReasoning验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) trained with Long
Chain-of-Thought (Long CoT) reasoning have demonstrated remarkable cross-domain
generalization capabilities. However, the underlying mechanisms supporting such
transfer remain poorly understood. We hypothesize that cross-domain
generalization arises from shared abstract reasoning prototypes -- fundamental
reasoning patterns that capture the essence of problems across domains. These
prototypes minimize the nuances of the representation, revealing that seemingly
diverse tasks are grounded in shared reasoning structures.Based on this
hypothesis, we propose ProtoReasoning, a framework that enhances the reasoning
ability of LLMs by leveraging scalable and verifiable prototypical
representations (Prolog for logical reasoning, PDDL for
planning).ProtoReasoning features: (1) an automated prototype construction
pipeline that transforms problems into corresponding prototype representations;
(2) a comprehensive verification system providing reliable feedback through
Prolog/PDDL interpreters; (3) the scalability to synthesize problems
arbitrarily within prototype space while ensuring correctness. Extensive
experiments show that ProtoReasoning achieves 4.7% improvement over baseline
models on logical reasoning (Enigmata-Eval), 6.3% improvement on planning
tasks, 4.0% improvement on general reasoning (MMLU) and 1.0% on mathematics
(AIME24). Significantly, our ablation studies confirm that learning in
prototype space also demonstrates enhanced generalization to structurally
similar problems compared to training solely on natural language
representations, validating our hypothesis that reasoning prototypes serve as
the foundation for generalizable reasoning in large language models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统评估指标（如ROUGE和BERTScore）难以捕捉语义相似性，而现有LLM评估方法缺乏直观解释性，且未区分问题类型。

Method: MinosEval首先区分问题类型：对事实性问题采用自适应关键点评分策略，对非事实性问题采用实例感知列表排序策略。

Result: 在多个开放性问题回答数据集上的实验表明，MinosEval与人工标注更一致，并提供更可解释的结果。

Conclusion: MinosEval通过针对不同问题类型定制评估策略，显著提升了开放性问题回答评估的效果。

Abstract: Open-ended question answering (QA) is a key task for evaluating the
capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Compared to closed-ended QA, it
demands longer answer statements, more nuanced reasoning processes, and diverse
expressions, making refined and interpretable automatic evaluation both crucial
and challenging. Traditional metrics like ROUGE and BERTScore struggle to
capture semantic similarities due to different patterns between model responses
and reference answers. Current LLM-based evaluation approaches, such as
pairwise or listwise comparisons of candidate answers, lack intuitive
interpretability. While pointwise scoring of each response provides some
descriptions, it fails to adapt across different question contents. Most
notably, existing methods overlook the distinction between factoid and
non-factoid questions. To address these challenges, we propose
\textbf{MinosEval}, a novel evaluation method that first distinguishes
open-ended questions and then ranks candidate answers using different
evaluation strategies. For factoid questions, it applies an adaptive key-point
scoring strategy, while for non-factoid questions, it uses an instance-aware
listwise ranking strategy. Experiments on multiple open-ended QA datasets,
including self-built ones with more candidate responses to complement community
resources, show that MinosEval better aligns with human annotations and offers
more interpretable results.

Result: 语言变体导致性能下降，尤其是巴斯克语；编码器模型对西巴斯克语处理困难。

Conclusion: 语言变体对模型性能有显著影响，西巴斯克语的挑战与语言学理论一致。

Abstract: In this paper, we evaluate the capacity of current language technologies to
understand Basque and Spanish language varieties. We use Natural Language
Inference (NLI) as a pivot task and introduce a novel, manually-curated
parallel dataset in Basque and Spanish, along with their respective variants.
Our empirical analysis of crosslingual and in-context learning experiments
using encoder-only and decoder-based Large Language Models (LLMs) shows a
performance drop when handling linguistic variation, especially in Basque.
Error analysis suggests that this decline is not due to lexical overlap, but
rather to the linguistic variation itself. Further ablation experiments
indicate that encoder-only models particularly struggle with Western Basque,
which aligns with linguistic theory that identifies peripheral dialects (e.g.,
Western) as more distant from the standard. All data and code are publicly
available.

collaborative mechanism between knowledge graphs and retrieval-augmented
generation, improving the alignment of general models with historical
knowledge. Experiments show that the domain-specific model Xunzi-Qwen1.5-14B,
with Simplified Chinese input and chain-of-thought prompting, achieves optimal
performance in relation extraction (F1 = 0.68). The DeepSeek model integrated
with GraphRAG improves F1 by 11% (0.08-0.19) on the open-domain C-CLUE relation
extraction dataset, surpassing the F1 value of Xunzi-Qwen1.5-14B (0.12),
effectively alleviating hallucinations phenomenon, and improving
interpretability. This framework offers a low-resource solution for classical
text knowledge extraction, advancing historical knowledge services and
humanities research.

TL;DR: TopClustRAG是一个结合稀疏和密集索引的混合检索系统，通过K-Means聚类和LLM生成多阶段答案，提升回答的多样性和相关性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大规模网络语料库中的问答问题，提升答案的多样性、相关性和忠实性。

Method: 采用混合检索策略（稀疏和密集索引），K-Means聚类分组相似段落，生成集群特定提示，通过LLM生成中间答案，最后过滤、重排并合成最终答案。

Result: 在FineWeb Sample-10BT数据集上，TopClustRAG在忠实性排名第2，正确性排名第7。

Conclusion: 基于聚类的上下文过滤和提示聚合在大规模RAG系统中有效。

Abstract: We present TopClustRAG, a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system
developed for the LiveRAG Challenge, which evaluates end-to-end question
answering over large-scale web corpora. Our system employs a hybrid retrieval
strategy combining sparse and dense indices, followed by K-Means clustering to
group semantically similar passages. Representative passages from each cluster
are used to construct cluster-specific prompts for a large language model
(LLM), generating intermediate answers that are filtered, reranked, and finally
synthesized into a single, comprehensive response. This multi-stage pipeline
enhances answer diversity, relevance, and faithfulness to retrieved evidence.
Evaluated on the FineWeb Sample-10BT dataset, TopClustRAG ranked 2nd in
faithfulness and 7th in correctness on the official leaderboard, demonstrating
the effectiveness of clustering-based context filtering and prompt aggregation
in large-scale RAG systems.

TL;DR: 论文提出了Thunder-DeID框架，用于高效去识别韩国法院判决书中的个人信息，满足法律要求并提升处理效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前韩国法院判决书的去识别方法无法满足大规模处理需求，且法律对个人标识的定义模糊，缺乏技术适应性。

Method: 构建首个韩国法律数据集，系统分类PII，开发基于DNN的端到端去识别流程。

Result: 实验表明，模型在法院判决书去识别任务中达到最优性能。

Conclusion: Thunder-DeID框架有效解决了法律与技术需求之间的脱节问题，为类似场景提供了参考。

Abstract: To ensure a balance between open access to justice and personal data
protection, the South Korean judiciary mandates the de-identification of court
judgments before they can be publicly disclosed. However, the current
de-identification process is inadequate for handling court judgments at scale
while adhering to strict legal requirements. Additionally, the legal
definitions and categorizations of personal identifiers are vague and not
well-suited for technical solutions. To tackle these challenges, we propose a
de-identification framework called Thunder-DeID, which aligns with relevant
laws and practices. Specifically, we (i) construct and release the first Korean
legal dataset containing annotated judgments along with corresponding lists of
entity mentions, (ii) introduce a systematic categorization of Personally
Identifiable Information (PII), and (iii) develop an end-to-end deep neural
network (DNN)-based de-identification pipeline. Our experimental results
demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance in the
de-identification of court judgments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLMs在通用NLP任务中表现优异，但在临床试验招募等关键领域的应用仍有限。论文旨在探索LLMs如何通过知识整合和推理能力改进试验与患者的匹配。

Method: 论文通过调查分析现有LLM辅助方法，评估其基准、方法和框架，并探讨了临床研究中采用LLM技术的挑战。

Result: 研究发现现有方法依赖专有模型和弱评估基准，限制了LLMs在临床试验招募中的潜力。

Conclusion: 论文强调了改进评估框架和开发更通用解决方案的必要性，并指出了未来研究方向。

Abstract: Recent advances in LLMs have greatly improved general-domain NLP tasks. Yet,
their adoption in critical domains, such as clinical trial recruitment, remains
limited. As trials are designed in natural language and patient data is
represented as both structured and unstructured text, the task of matching
trials and patients benefits from knowledge aggregation and reasoning abilities
of LLMs. Classical approaches are trial-specific and LLMs with their ability to
consolidate distributed knowledge hold the potential to build a more general
solution. Yet recent applications of LLM-assisted methods rely on proprietary
models and weak evaluation benchmarks. In this survey, we are the first to
analyze the task of trial-patient matching and contextualize emerging LLM-based
approaches in clinical trial recruitment. We critically examine existing
benchmarks, approaches and evaluation frameworks, the challenges to adopting
LLM technologies in clinical research and exciting future directions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低资源语言在语言识别（LID）中表现不佳，主要由于数据不平衡和单域数据（如圣经）的限制，需要一种方法提升其跨域性能。

Method: 采用监督对比学习（SCL）方法，学习低资源语言的域不变表示，以解决数据不平衡和偏差问题。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在低资源语言的跨域数据上提升了3.2%的LID性能。

Conclusion: 监督对比学习（SCL）能有效提升低资源语言的跨域识别能力，为LID模型提供了改进方向。

Abstract: Language identification (LID) is a critical step in curating multilingual LLM
pretraining corpora from web crawls. While many studies on LID model training
focus on collecting diverse training data to improve performance, low-resource
languages -- often limited to single-domain data, such as the Bible -- continue
to perform poorly. To resolve these class imbalance and bias issues, we propose
a novel supervised contrastive learning (SCL) approach to learn
domain-invariant representations for low-resource languages. Through an
extensive analysis, we show that our approach improves LID performance on
out-of-domain data for low-resource languages by 3.2%, demonstrating its
effectiveness in enhancing LID models.

Motivation: 当前评估方法难以区分LLMs的真实医学推理与表面模式，需更精细的测试框架。

Method: 构建ICU出院记录数据集（MIMIC-IV），生成真实与模板版本，评估五种LLMs在零样本和微调下的行为。

Result: 零样本模型反事实推理更一致，微调模型更稳定但对临床变化敏感度低；人口因素对输出有细微但持续影响。

Conclusion: 行为测试揭示临床LLMs的推理策略，为设计更安全透明的医疗AI系统提供依据。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in clinical decision
support, yet current evaluation methods often fail to distinguish genuine
medical reasoning from superficial patterns. We introduce DeVisE (Demographics
and Vital signs Evaluation), a behavioral testing framework for probing
fine-grained clinical understanding. We construct a dataset of ICU discharge
notes from MIMIC-IV, generating both raw (real-world) and template-based
(synthetic) versions with controlled single-variable counterfactuals targeting
demographic (age, gender, ethnicity) and vital sign attributes. We evaluate
five LLMs spanning general-purpose and medically fine-tuned variants, under
both zero-shot and fine-tuned settings. We assess model behavior via (1)
input-level sensitivity - how counterfactuals alter the likelihood of a note;
and (2) downstream reasoning - how they affect predicted hospital
length-of-stay. Our results show that zero-shot models exhibit more coherent
counterfactual reasoning patterns, while fine-tuned models tend to be more
stable yet less responsive to clinically meaningful changes. Notably,
demographic factors subtly but consistently influence outputs, emphasizing the
importance of fairness-aware evaluation. This work highlights the utility of
behavioral testing in exposing the reasoning strategies of clinical LLMs and
informing the design of safer, more transparent medical AI systems.

Motivation: 语言模型的全球有效性依赖于对本地社会文化背景的理解，但现有模型在印度文化多样性方面的表现不足。

Method: 构建SANSKRITI数据集，包含21,853个问题-答案对，覆盖16个文化属性，并在主流语言模型上进行评估。

Result: 评估显示，许多模型在处理文化多样性查询时表现不佳，尤其在区域特定背景下。

Conclusion: SANSKRITI为评估和改进语言模型的文化理解能力设定了新标准。

Abstract: Language Models (LMs) are indispensable tools shaping modern workflows, but
their global effectiveness depends on understanding local socio-cultural
contexts. To address this, we introduce SANSKRITI, a benchmark designed to
evaluate language models' comprehension of India's rich cultural diversity.
Comprising 21,853 meticulously curated question-answer pairs spanning 28 states
and 8 union territories, SANSKRITI is the largest dataset for testing Indian
cultural knowledge. It covers sixteen key attributes of Indian culture: rituals
and ceremonies, history, tourism, cuisine, dance and music, costume, language,
art, festivals, religion, medicine, transport, sports, nightlife, and
personalities, providing a comprehensive representation of India's cultural
tapestry. We evaluate SANSKRITI on leading Large Language Models (LLMs), Indic
Language Models (ILMs), and Small Language Models (SLMs), revealing significant
disparities in their ability to handle culturally nuanced queries, with many
models struggling in region-specific contexts. By offering an extensive,
culturally rich, and diverse dataset, SANSKRITI sets a new standard for
assessing and improving the cultural understanding of LMs.

Motivation: 针对印度语言在多模态多语言摘要研究中资源不足的问题，旨在通过整合用户反馈和多模态数据提升摘要质量。

Method: 构建了包含9种印度语言的COSMMIC数据集，采用四种配置（纯文本、文本+评论、文本+图片、全组合）进行摘要生成，并利用LLama3、GPT-4等模型评估效果。

Result: 实验表明，结合文本、评论和图片的配置效果最佳，同时通过IndicBERT和CLIP-based分类器优化了评论和图片的利用。

Conclusion: COSMMIC填补了印度语言多模态摘要的空白，为NLP研究提供了新资源，并推动了包容性发展。

Abstract: Despite progress in comment-aware multimodal and multilingual summarization
for English and Chinese, research in Indian languages remains limited. This
study addresses this gap by introducing COSMMIC, a pioneering comment-sensitive
multimodal, multilingual dataset featuring nine major Indian languages. COSMMIC
comprises 4,959 article-image pairs and 24,484 reader comments, with
ground-truth summaries available in all included languages. Our approach
enhances summaries by integrating reader insights and feedback. We explore
summarization and headline generation across four configurations: (1) using
article text alone, (2) incorporating user comments, (3) utilizing images, and
(4) combining text, comments, and images. To assess the dataset's
effectiveness, we employ state-of-the-art language models such as LLama3 and
GPT-4. We conduct a comprehensive study to evaluate different component
combinations, including identifying supportive comments, filtering out noise
using a dedicated comment classifier using IndicBERT, and extracting valuable
insights from images with a multilingual CLIP-based classifier. This helps
determine the most effective configurations for natural language generation
(NLG) tasks. Unlike many existing datasets that are either text-only or lack
user comments in multimodal settings, COSMMIC uniquely integrates text, images,
and user feedback. This holistic approach bridges gaps in Indian language
resources, advancing NLP research and fostering inclusivity.

*Stanley Ngugi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为TLI（Targeted Lexical Injection）的微调方法，通过利用早期内部层的词嵌入，显著提升了低资源语言（如斯瓦希里语）在大型语言模型中的词汇对齐能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低资源语言在大型语言模型中的表现不足，主要由于数据稀缺和预训练中的代表性不足。词汇对齐是关键挑战之一。

Method: 采用LoRA（Low-Rank Adaptation）和对比学习目标，针对早期层（如第2层）的词嵌入进行微调。

Result: TLI显著提升了623个训练词对的词汇对齐（相似度从0.3211提升至0.4113），并在63个未见词对上表现出良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: TLI是一种参数高效且有效的方法，能够增强模型在低资源语言中的词汇对齐能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities, yet
their performance in low-resource languages (LRLs), such as Swahili, often lags
due to data scarcity and underrepresentation in pre-training. A key challenge
is achieving robust cross-lingual lexical alignment, crucial for tasks like
translation and cross-lingual information retrieval. This paper introduces
Targeted Lexical Injection (TLI), a novel and efficient fine-tuning approach.
We first demonstrate that Lugha-Llama-8B-wura, a Swahili-centric LLM, exhibits
strong, near-perfect lexical alignment for Swahili-English word pairs in its
early internal layers (specifically Layer 2, with ~0.99998 average cosine
similarity based on a pilot study), a capability not fully reflected in its
final output representations (baseline ~0.32 similarity on our evaluation set).
TLI leverages this insight by using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and a
contrastive learning objective to fine-tune the model, specifically targeting
embeddings from this empirically identified optimal early layer. Our
experiments show that TLI significantly improves the output-level lexical
alignment for 623 trained Swahili-English word pairs, increasing average cosine
similarity from 0.3211 to 0.4113 (+28.08%, p < 1.33 x 10^-240). More
importantly, these improvements generalize remarkably well to 63 unseen control
word pairs, with similarity increasing from 0.3143 to 0.4033 (+28.32%, p < 7.17
x 10^-27). These findings suggest TLI enhances the model's ability to preserve
and propagate its inherent early-layer cross-lingual knowledge, offering a
parameter-efficient and effective strategy for improving lexical alignment in
LRL-focused LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管MLLMs在GUI代理中表现出色，但其存在系统性定位错误（幻觉），影响了可靠性。

Method: 提出了细粒度评估框架和PSS指标，并引入Context-Aware Cropping技术。

Result: 实验表明，框架和方法提升了GUI代理的可解释性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该研究为GUI代理的行为提供了可操作的见解，并增强了其性能。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have enabled GUI agents to interact
with operating systems by grounding language into spatial actions. Despite
their promising performance, these models frequently exhibit
hallucinations-systematic localization errors that compromise reliability. We
propose a fine-grained evaluation framework that categorizes model predictions
into four distinct types, revealing nuanced failure modes beyond traditional
accuracy metrics. To better quantify model uncertainty, we introduce the Peak
Sharpness Score (PSS), a metric that evaluates the alignment between semantic
continuity and logits distribution in coordinate prediction. Building on this
insight, we further propose Context-Aware Cropping, a training-free technique
that improves model performance by adaptively refining input context. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our framework and methods provide actionable
insights and enhance the interpretability and robustness of GUI agent behavior.

Motivation: 当前多智能体系统在架构设计、跨领域泛化和性能保证方面面临挑战，尤其是在任务复杂性和智能体数量增加时。

Method: 提出三个核心创新：分层任务森林结构、自适应协作引擎和智能体组织优化策略。

Result: 在多个领域表现优异，如GSM8K准确率91.50%，AIME准确率30.4%，HumanEval pass@1达79.20%，且在复杂任务中优势更明显。

Conclusion: AgentGroupChat-V2为高效、通用的多智能体系统提供了全面解决方案，尤其在复杂推理场景中表现突出。

Abstract: Large language model based multi-agent systems have demonstrated significant
potential in social simulation and complex task resolution domains. However,
current frameworks face critical challenges in system architecture design,
cross-domain generalizability, and performance guarantees, particularly as task
complexity and number of agents increases. We introduces AgentGroupChat-V2, a
novel framework addressing these challenges through three core innovations: (1)
a divide-and-conquer fully parallel architecture that decomposes user queries
into hierarchical task forest structures enabling dependency management and
distributed concurrent processing. (2) an adaptive collaboration engine that
dynamically selects heterogeneous LLM combinations and interaction modes based
on task characteristics. (3) agent organization optimization strategies
combining divide-and-conquer approaches for efficient problem decomposition.
Extensive experiments demonstrate AgentGroupChat-V2's superior performance
across diverse domains, achieving 91.50% accuracy on GSM8K (exceeding the best
baseline by 5.6 percentage points), 30.4% accuracy on competition-level AIME
(nearly doubling other methods), and 79.20% pass@1 on HumanEval. Performance
advantages become increasingly pronounced with higher task difficulty,
particularly on Level 5 MATH problems where improvements exceed 11 percentage
points compared to state-of-the-art baselines. These results confirm that
AgentGroupChat-V2 provides a comprehensive solution for building efficient,
general-purpose LLM multi-agent systems with significant advantages in complex
reasoning scenarios. Code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究LLMs的高准确性是否源于真实推理能力还是训练数据的统计记忆。

Method: 引入RE-IMAGINE框架，生成符号化问题变体，测试LLMs在不同推理层次的表现。

Result: LLMs在问题变体上表现下降，显示其部分依赖统计记忆。

Conclusion: RE-IMAGINE为评估LLMs推理能力提供了新方法，揭示了其局限性。

Abstract: Recent Large Language Models (LLMs) have reported high accuracy on reasoning
benchmarks. However, it is still unclear whether the observed results arise
from true reasoning or from statistical recall of the training set. Inspired by
the ladder of causation (Pearl, 2009) and its three levels (associations,
interventions and counterfactuals), this paper introduces RE-IMAGINE, a
framework to characterize a hierarchy of reasoning ability in LLMs, alongside
an automated pipeline to generate problem variations at different levels of the
hierarchy. By altering problems in an intermediate symbolic representation,
RE-IMAGINE generates arbitrarily many problems that are not solvable using
memorization alone. Moreover, the framework is general and can work across
reasoning domains, including math, code, and logic. We demonstrate our
framework on four widely-used benchmarks to evaluate several families of LLMs,
and observe reductions in performance when the models are queried with problem
variations. These assessments indicate a degree of reliance on statistical
recall for past performance, and open the door to further research targeting
skills across the reasoning hierarchy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在推理时简单附加上下文无法确保生成的响应基于外部知识，因此需要一种更有效的方法来提升模型的生成能力。

Method: 提出CINGS方法，训练时将相关上下文前置到响应中，计算损失时仅考虑响应标记并屏蔽上下文。

Result: 实验表明，CINGS训练的模型在文本和视觉领域均表现出更强的生成能力，且在多个基准测试中优于其他方法。

Conclusion: CINGS通过改变模型对先验知识的依赖，显著提升了生成能力，同时不影响下游任务性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are often supplemented with external knowledge
to provide information not encoded in their parameters or to reduce
hallucination. In such cases, we expect the model to generate responses by
grounding its response in the provided external context. However, prior work
has shown that simply appending context at inference time does not ensure
grounded generation. To address this, we propose Context-INformed Grounding
Supervision (CINGS), a post-training supervision in which the model is trained
with relevant context prepended to the response, while computing the loss only
over the response tokens and masking out the context. Our experiments
demonstrate that models trained with CINGS exhibit stronger grounding in both
textual and visual domains compared to standard instruction-tuned models. In
the text domain, CINGS outperforms other training methods across 11
information-seeking datasets and is complementary to inference-time grounding
techniques. In the vision-language domain, replacing a vision-language model's
LLM backbone with a CINGS-trained model reduces hallucinations across four
benchmarks and maintains factual consistency throughout the generated response.
This improved grounding comes without degradation in general downstream
performance. Finally, we analyze the mechanism underlying the enhanced
grounding in CINGS and find that it induces a shift in the model's prior
knowledge and behavior, implicitly encouraging greater reliance on the external
context.

Abstract: Process or step-wise supervision has played a crucial role in advancing
complex multi-step reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs).
However, efficient, high-quality automated process annotation remains a
significant challenge. To address this, we introduce Single-Pass Annotation
with Reference-Guided Evaluation (SPARE), a novel structured framework that
enables single-pass, per-step annotation by aligning each solution step to one
or multiple steps in a reference solution, accompanied by explicit reasoning
for evaluation. We show that reference-guided step-level evaluation effectively
facilitates process supervision on four datasets spanning three domains:
mathematical reasoning, multi-hop compositional question answering, and spatial
reasoning. We demonstrate that SPARE, when compared to baselines, improves
reasoning performance when used for: (1) fine-tuning models in an offline RL
setup for inference-time greedy-decoding, and (2) training reward models for
ranking/aggregating multiple LLM-generated outputs. Additionally, SPARE
achieves competitive performance on challenging mathematical datasets while
offering 2.6 times greater efficiency, requiring only 38% of the runtime,
compared to tree search-based automatic annotation. The codebase, along with a
trained SPARE-PRM model, is publicly released to facilitate further research
and reproducibility.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 夸张和隐喻在自然语言处理中具有重要意义，但由于其语义模糊和表达多样，检测难度较大。现有方法多关注表面特征，忽略了情感关联和双向交互的作用。

Method: EmoBi框架包含情感分析模块、基于情感的领域映射模块和双向动态交互模块，通过情感挖掘和双向交互提升检测效果，并设计了验证机制确保准确性。

Result: 实验显示，EmoBi在四个数据集上均优于基线方法，F1分数在TroFi数据集上提升28.1%（夸张检测），在HYPO-L数据集上提升23.1%（隐喻检测）。

Conclusion: EmoBi框架通过情感引导和双向交互显著提升了夸张和隐喻检测的效果，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Text-based hyperbole and metaphor detection are of great significance for
natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, due to their semantic
obscurity and expressive diversity, it is rather challenging to identify them.
Existing methods mostly focus on superficial text features, ignoring the
associations of hyperbole and metaphor as well as the effect of implicit
emotion on perceiving these rhetorical devices. To implement these hypotheses,
we propose an emotion-guided hyperbole and metaphor detection framework based
on bidirectional dynamic interaction (EmoBi). Firstly, the emotion analysis
module deeply mines the emotion connotations behind hyperbole and metaphor.
Next, the emotion-based domain mapping module identifies the target and source
domains to gain a deeper understanding of the implicit meanings of hyperbole
and metaphor. Finally, the bidirectional dynamic interaction module enables the
mutual promotion between hyperbole and metaphor. Meanwhile, a verification
mechanism is designed to ensure detection accuracy and reliability. Experiments
show that EmoBi outperforms all baseline methods on four datasets.
Specifically, compared to the current SoTA, the F1 score increased by 28.1% for
hyperbole detection on the TroFi dataset and 23.1% for metaphor detection on
the HYPO-L dataset. These results, underpinned by in-depth analyses, underscore
the effectiveness and potential of our approach for advancing hyperbole and
metaphor detection.

Abstract: Generating grounded and trustworthy responses remains a key challenge for
large language models (LLMs). While retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with
citation-based grounding holds promise, instruction-tuned models frequently
fail even in straightforward scenarios: missing explicitly stated answers,
citing incorrectly, or refusing when evidence is available. In this work, we
explore how reinforcement learning (RL) and internal reasoning can enhance
grounding in LLMs. We use the GRPO (Group Relative Policy Optimization) method
to train models using verifiable outcome-based rewards targeting answer
correctness, citation sufficiency, and refusal quality, without requiring gold
reasoning traces or expensive annotations. Through comprehensive experiments
across ASQA, QAMPARI, ELI5, and ExpertQA we show that reasoning-augmented
models significantly outperform instruction-only variants, especially in
handling unanswerable queries and generating well-cited responses. A two-stage
training setup, first optimizing answer and citation behavior and then refusal,
further improves grounding by stabilizing the learning signal. Additionally, we
revisit instruction tuning via GPT-4 distillation and find that combining it
with GRPO enhances performance on long-form, generative QA tasks. Overall, our
findings highlight the value of reasoning, stage-wise optimization, and
outcome-driven RL for building more verifiable and reliable LLMs.

### [102] [RATTENTION: Towards the Minimal Sliding Window Size in Local-Global Attention Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15545)
*Bailin Wang,Chang Lan,Chong Wang,Ruoming Pang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RATTENTION是一种结合局部注意力和线性注意力的模型，旨在解决局部注意力忽略窗口外标记的问题，在性能和效率之间实现更好的平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决局部注意力模型完全忽略窗口外标记的固有局限性，提升短上下文场景下的效率。

Method: 提出RATTENTION，结合局部注意力和线性注意力机制，捕获窗口外标记的信息。

Result: 在3B和12B规模的预训练实验中，RATTENTION以512的窗口大小匹配全注意力模型的性能，并在长上下文任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: RATTENTION在保持训练效率的同时，显著提升了局部注意力模型的性能和适用性。

Abstract: Local-global attention models have recently emerged as compelling
alternatives to standard Transformers, promising improvements in both training
and inference efficiency. However, the crucial choice of window size presents a
Pareto tradeoff: larger windows maintain performance akin to full attention but
offer minimal efficiency gains in short-context scenarios, while smaller
windows can lead to performance degradation. Current models, such as Gemma2 and
Mistral, adopt conservative window sizes (e.g., 4096 out of an 8192 pretraining
length) to preserve performance. This work investigates strategies to shift
this Pareto frontier, enabling local-global models to achieve efficiency gains
even in short-context regimes. Our core motivation is to address the intrinsic
limitation of local attention -- its complete disregard for tokens outside the
defined window. We explore RATTENTION, a variant of local attention integrated
with a specialized linear attention mechanism designed to capture information
from these out-of-window tokens. Pretraining experiments at the 3B and 12B
scales demonstrate that RATTENTION achieves a superior Pareto tradeoff between
performance and efficiency. As a sweet spot, RATTENTION with a window size of
just 512 consistently matches the performance of full-attention models across
diverse settings. Furthermore, the recurrent nature inherent in the linear
attention component of RATTENTION contributes to enhanced long-context
performance, as validated on the RULER benchmark. Crucially, these improvements
do not compromise training efficiency; thanks to a specialized kernel
implementation and the reduced window size, RATTENTION maintains training
speeds comparable to existing state-of-the-art approaches.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种从模型权重中近似训练数据的方法，通过梯度选择公共文本库中匹配度最高的数据，显著提升了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代语言模型通常公开权重但封闭训练数据，研究旨在解决如何从权重中近似原始训练数据的问题。

Method: 采用梯度基方法从大型公共文本库中选择匹配度最高的数据，验证其在分类和监督微调任务中的有效性。

Result: 在AG News分类任务中，性能从65%提升至80%；在MSMARCO微调任务中，困惑度从3.3降至2.3。

Conclusion: 该方法能从公共数据中高效恢复近似训练数据，显著提升模型性能，接近专家基准。

Abstract: Modern language models often have open weights but closed training data. We
formalize the problem of data approximation from model weights and propose
several baselines and metrics. We develop a gradient-based approach that
selects the highest-matching data from a large public text corpus and show its
effectiveness at recovering useful data given only weights of the original and
finetuned models. Even when none of the true training data is known, our method
is able to locate a small subset of public Web documents can be used to train a
model to close to the original model performance given models trained for both
classification and supervised-finetuning. On the AG News classification task,
our method improves performance from 65% (using randomly selected data) to 80%,
approaching the expert benchmark of 88%. When applied to a model trained with
SFT on MSMARCO web documents, our method reduces perplexity from 3.3 to 2.3,
compared to an expert LLAMA model's perplexity of 2.0.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出Predictive Generation (PredGen)框架，通过预测性解码减少LLMs在实时语音聊天中的延迟，提升用户体验。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在实时语音聊天中因生成第一句话的延迟导致用户体验不佳，尤其是在计算能力有限的设备上。

Method: 提出PredGen框架，利用用户说话时的空闲计算资源预测生成候选响应，提前启动TTS处理。

Result: 模拟实验显示，PredGen能减少约2倍的延迟，且额外计算成本极低。

Conclusion: PredGen有效解决了LLMs在实时语音应用中的延迟问题，显著提升响应速度。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used in real-time voice chat
applications, typically in combination with text-to-speech (TTS) systems to
generate audio responses. However, their large size often leads to noticeable
latency between the end of user input and the start of audio output, resulting
in suboptimal user experiences. This latency is particularly evident when LLMs
are deployed as single-user voice assistants on consumer-grade hardware with
limited computing capacity. We discovered that this latency is primarily
dominated by the time it takes for the LLMs to generate the first sentence,
which is required as input by the TTS systems that synthesize audio responses
on a sentence-by-sentence basis. To address this bottleneck, we propose
Predictive Generation (PredGen), a novel framework that mitigates-or even
eliminates-this delay through speculative decoding at input time. PredGen
generates candidate responses while the user is still speaking, enabling the
system to begin TTS processing with minimal delay. Simulated experiments on the
Lmsys and MT-Bench datasets show that the proposed method can effectively
reduce the latency by around 2x across a wide range of use cases, while
incurring only minimal additional computation cost at input time-computation
that would otherwise go unused.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的性别包容性公平指数（GIFI），用于全面评估大型语言模型（LLMs）对二元和非二元性别的处理能力，发现模型之间存在显著差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注二元性别区分，缺乏对非二元性别的包容性评估，因此需要一种更全面的指标来量化LLMs的性别公平性。

Method: 引入GIFI指标，通过多层次的评估（如代词测试、生成行为和认知行为测试）揭示LLMs在不同性别假设下的偏见。

Result: 对22种开源和专有LLMs的评估显示，模型在性别包容性上存在显著差异。

Conclusion: 研究强调了提升LLMs性别包容性的重要性，并为未来性别公平性研究提供了关键基准。

Abstract: We present a comprehensive evaluation of gender fairness in large language
models (LLMs), focusing on their ability to handle both binary and non-binary
genders. While previous studies primarily focus on binary gender distinctions,
we introduce the Gender Inclusivity Fairness Index (GIFI), a novel and
comprehensive metric that quantifies the diverse gender inclusivity of LLMs.
GIFI consists of a wide range of evaluations at different levels, from simply
probing the model with respect to provided gender pronouns to testing various
aspects of model generation and cognitive behaviors under different gender
assumptions, revealing biases associated with varying gender identifiers. We
conduct extensive evaluations with GIFI on 22 prominent open-source and
proprietary LLMs of varying sizes and capabilities, discovering significant
variations in LLMs' gender inclusivity. Our study highlights the importance of
improving LLMs' inclusivity, providing a critical benchmark for future
advancements in gender fairness in generative models.

Motivation: 当前缺乏专门用于评估多模态科学声明验证能力的基准，SciVer填补了这一空白，旨在推动模型在科学文献中的理解和推理能力。

Method: SciVer基于1113篇科学论文构建了3000个专家标注的示例，涵盖4种推理类型，并评估了21种前沿多模态基础模型的性能。

Result: 实验表明，当前模型（如o4-mini、Gemini-2.5-Flash等）与人类专家在SciVer上的表现存在显著差距。通过RAG和人工错误分析，揭示了开源模型的关键局限性。

Conclusion: SciVer为多模态科学声明验证提供了首个基准，揭示了当前模型的不足，为未来模型改进提供了重要方向。

Abstract: We introduce SciVer, the first benchmark specifically designed to evaluate
the ability of foundation models to verify claims within a multimodal
scientific context. SciVer consists of 3,000 expert-annotated examples over
1,113 scientific papers, covering four subsets, each representing a common

fine-grained evaluation, each example includes expert-annotated supporting
evidence. We assess the performance of 21 state-of-the-art multimodal
foundation models, including o4-mini, Gemini-2.5-Flash, Llama-3.2-Vision, and
Qwen2.5-VL. Our experiment reveals a substantial performance gap between these
models and human experts on SciVer. Through an in-depth analysis of
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and human-conducted error evaluations, we

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的任务DiscoSG，用于解决多句子视觉描述中的场景图解析问题，并提出了数据集DiscoSG-DS和模型DiscoSG-Refiner。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本场景图解析器通常针对单句子设计，无法有效处理多句子描述中的跨句子共指现象，导致图解析结果碎片化，影响下游任务性能。

Method: 论文提出了DiscoSG任务，并构建了包含多句子标注的数据集DiscoSG-DS。同时，提出了DiscoSG-Refiner模型，通过两个小型PLM分阶段生成和优化场景图。

Result: DiscoSG-Refiner在SPICE指标上比基线方法提升了约30%，推理速度比GPT-4快86倍，同时提升了下游任务性能。

Conclusion: DiscoSG-Refiner是一种高效且性能优越的多句子场景图解析方法，适用于开源环境。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) now generate discourse-level, multi-sentence
visual descriptions, challenging text scene graph parsers originally designed
for single-sentence caption-to-graph mapping. Current approaches typically
merge sentence-level parsing outputs for discourse input, often missing
phenomena like cross-sentence coreference, resulting in fragmented graphs and
degraded downstream VLM task performance. To address this, we introduce a new
task, Discourse-level text Scene Graph parsing (DiscoSG), supported by our
dataset DiscoSG-DS, which comprises 400 expert-annotated and 8,430 synthesised
multi-sentence caption-graph pairs for images. Each caption averages 9
sentences, and each graph contains at least 3 times more triples than those in
existing datasets. While fine-tuning large PLMs (i.e., GPT-4) on DiscoSG-DS
improves SPICE by approximately 48% over the best sentence-merging baseline,
high inference cost and restrictive licensing hinder its open-source use, and
smaller fine-tuned PLMs struggle with complex graphs. We propose
DiscoSG-Refiner, which drafts a base graph using one small PLM, then employs a
second PLM to iteratively propose graph edits, reducing full-graph generation
overhead. Using two Flan-T5-Base models, DiscoSG-Refiner still improves SPICE
by approximately 30% over the best baseline while achieving 86 times faster
inference than GPT-4. It also consistently improves downstream VLM tasks like
discourse-level caption evaluation and hallucination detection. Code and data
are available at: https://github.com/ShaoqLin/DiscoSG

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文介绍了WikiMixQA，一个包含1000道多选题的基准测试，用于评估从4000个维基百科页面提取的表格和图表的跨模态推理能力。研究发现，现有模型在长文档检索和多模态推理方面表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文档通常包含复杂布局、表格和图表，这对自动文档理解（DU）提出了挑战。尽管视觉语言大模型（VLLMs）在多项任务中表现优异，但其处理长上下文视觉输入的能力尚不明确。

Method: 论文提出WikiMixQA基准，包含1000道多选题，覆盖7个主题的4000个维基百科页面，要求模型综合多模态信息进行复杂推理。评估了12种最先进的视觉语言模型。

Result: 专有模型在直接提供上下文时准确率约70%，但在长文档检索时性能显著下降。GPT-4-o是唯一在此设置下准确率超过50%的模型，开源模型最高准确率仅为27%。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了长上下文多模态推理的挑战，并将WikiMixQA确立为推进文档理解研究的重要基准。

Abstract: Documents are fundamental to preserving and disseminating information, often
incorporating complex layouts, tables, and charts that pose significant
challenges for automatic document understanding (DU). While vision-language
large models (VLLMs) have demonstrated improvements across various tasks, their
effectiveness in processing long-context vision inputs remains unclear. This
paper introduces WikiMixQA, a benchmark comprising 1,000 multiple-choice
questions (MCQs) designed to evaluate cross-modal reasoning over tables and
charts extracted from 4,000 Wikipedia pages spanning seven distinct topics.
Unlike existing benchmarks, WikiMixQA emphasizes complex reasoning by requiring
models to synthesize information from multiple modalities. We evaluate 12
state-of-the-art vision-language models, revealing that while proprietary
models achieve ~70% accuracy when provided with direct context, their
performance deteriorates significantly when retrieval from long documents is
required. Among these, GPT-4-o is the only model exceeding 50% accuracy in this
setting, whereas open-source models perform considerably worse, with a maximum
accuracy of 27%. These findings underscore the challenges of long-context,
multi-modal reasoning and establish WikiMixQA as a crucial benchmark for
advancing document understanding research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手动创建多难度和针对性阅读技能的MCQ耗时且昂贵，生成式AI提供了自动化可能，但对其质量和可靠性的评估不足，尤其是其他语言的研究较少。

Method: 研究使用生成模型为葡萄牙语生成阅读理解MCQ，涵盖课程相关叙事元素和不同难度，通过专家评审和学生反应的心理测量学分析评估。

Result: 当前模型生成的MCQ质量接近人工编写，但存在语义清晰度和干扰项设计的问题。

Conclusion: 生成式AI在葡萄牙语MCQ生成中表现良好，但需进一步改进语义和干扰项设计以满足实际应用需求。

Abstract: While MCQs are valuable for learning and evaluation, manually creating them
with varying difficulty levels and targeted reading skills remains a
time-consuming and costly task. Recent advances in generative AI provide an
opportunity to automate MCQ generation efficiently. However, assessing the
actual quality and reliability of generated MCQs has received limited attention
-- particularly regarding cases where generation fails. This aspect becomes
particularly important when the generated MCQs are meant to be applied in
real-world settings. Additionally, most MCQ generation studies focus on
English, leaving other languages underexplored. This paper investigates the
capabilities of current generative models in producing MCQs for reading
comprehension in Portuguese, a morphologically rich language. Our study focuses
on generating MCQs that align with curriculum-relevant narrative elements and
span different difficulty levels. We evaluate these MCQs through expert review
and by analyzing the psychometric properties extracted from student responses
to assess their suitability for elementary school students. Our results show
that current models can generate MCQs of comparable quality to human-authored
ones. However, we identify issues related to semantic clarity and
answerability. Also, challenges remain in generating distractors that engage
students and meet established criteria for high-quality MCQ option design.

Result: 识别最优后悔表示层，发现M形解耦模式，分类神经元功能组。

Conclusion: 提出的方法和指标有效，为后悔机制研究提供新工具。

Abstract: Regret in Large Language Models refers to their explicit regret expression
when presented with evidence contradicting their previously generated
misinformation. Studying the regret mechanism is crucial for enhancing model
reliability and helps in revealing how cognition is coded in neural networks.
To understand this mechanism, we need to first identify regret expressions in
model outputs, then analyze their internal representation. This analysis
requires examining the model's hidden states, where information processing
occurs at the neuron level. However, this faces three key challenges: (1) the
absence of specialized datasets capturing regret expressions, (2) the lack of
metrics to find the optimal regret representation layer, and (3) the lack of
metrics for identifying and analyzing regret neurons. Addressing these
limitations, we propose: (1) a workflow for constructing a comprehensive regret
dataset through strategically designed prompting scenarios, (2) the Supervised
Compression-Decoupling Index (S-CDI) metric to identify optimal regret
representation layers, and (3) the Regret Dominance Score (RDS) metric to
identify regret neurons and the Group Impact Coefficient (GIC) to analyze
activation patterns. Our experimental results successfully identified the
optimal regret representation layer using the S-CDI metric, which significantly
enhanced performance in probe classification experiments. Additionally, we
discovered an M-shaped decoupling pattern across model layers, revealing how
information processing alternates between coupling and decoupling phases.
Through the RDS metric, we categorized neurons into three distinct functional
groups: regret neurons, non-regret neurons, and dual neurons.

Motivation: 探讨跨文化交际中误解的根源，特别是英式和美式英语对强调词的不同理解是否源于字面意义或语用因素。

Method: 通过三个实验和计算认知模型，分析听众如何递归推理说话者在信息性、礼貌和话语成本之间的权衡。

Result: 跨文化差异源于字面意义和话语成本权重的不同组合，而非单一因素。

Conclusion: 跨文化理解差异是字面意义与语用因素复杂互动的结果，挑战了仅基于语义或礼貌规范的解释。

Abstract: Misunderstandings in cross-cultural communication often arise from subtle
differences in interpretation, but it is unclear whether these differences
arise from the literal meanings assigned to words or from more general
pragmatic factors such as norms around politeness and brevity. In this paper,
we report three experiments examining how speakers of British and American
English interpret intensifiers like "quite" and "very." To better understand
these cross-cultural differences, we developed a computational cognitive model
where listeners recursively reason about speakers who balance informativity,
politeness, and utterance cost. Our model comparisons suggested that
cross-cultural differences in intensifier interpretation stem from a
combination of (1) different literal meanings, (2) different weights on
utterance cost. These findings challenge accounts based purely on semantic
variation or politeness norms, demonstrating that cross-cultural differences in
interpretation emerge from an intricate interplay between the two.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究生成式常识推理任务中，LLMs在遵循指定概念顺序生成句子时的能力不足，需改进指令遵循和组合泛化能力。

Method: 提出Ordered CommonGen基准，通过测量有序覆盖率评估LLMs的能力，并分析了36种LLMs的表现。

Result: LLMs虽能理解指令意图，但对特定顺序模式的偏好导致输出多样性低；最佳模型的有序覆盖率仅约75%。

Conclusion: 现有LLMs在指令遵循和组合泛化能力上仍需提升，Ordered CommonGen为未来研究提供了评估工具。

Abstract: In generative commonsense reasoning tasks such as CommonGen, generative large
language models (LLMs) compose sentences that include all given concepts.
However, when focusing on instruction-following capabilities, if a prompt
specifies a concept order, LLMs must generate sentences that adhere to the
specified order. To address this, we propose Ordered CommonGen, a benchmark
designed to evaluate the compositional generalization and instruction-following
abilities of LLMs. This benchmark measures ordered coverage to assess whether
concepts are generated in the specified order, enabling a simultaneous
evaluation of both abilities. We conducted a comprehensive analysis using 36
LLMs and found that, while LLMs generally understand the intent of
instructions, biases toward specific concept order patterns often lead to
low-diversity outputs or identical results even when the concept order is
altered. Moreover, even the most instruction-compliant LLM achieved only about
75% ordered coverage, highlighting the need for improvements in both
instruction-following and compositional generalization capabilities.

Motivation: 大型语言模型在推理任务中表现不稳定，需要一种方法提升其一致性和鲁棒性。

Method: 提出CC-Learn框架，通过强化学习优化同类问题的推理一致性，结合准确性、检索奖励和拒绝惩罚。

Result: 在ARC-Challenge和StrategyQA等基准测试中，CC-Learn显著提升了模型的准确性和推理稳定性。

Conclusion: CC-Learn证明通过同类问题的强化学习可以有效提升LLM的推理一致性。

Abstract: Large language models excel at many tasks but still struggle with consistent,
robust reasoning. We introduce Cohort-based Consistency Learning (CC-Learn), a
reinforcement learning framework that improves the reliability of LLM reasoning
by training on cohorts of similar questions derived from shared programmatic
abstractions. To enforce cohort-level consistency, we define a composite
objective combining cohort accuracy, a retrieval bonus for effective problem
decomposition, and a rejection penalty for trivial or invalid lookups that
reinforcement learning can directly optimize, unlike supervised fine-tuning.
Optimizing this reward guides the model to adopt uniform reasoning patterns
across all cohort members. Experiments on challenging reasoning benchmarks
(including ARC-Challenge and StrategyQA) show that CC-Learn boosts both
accuracy and reasoning stability over pretrained and SFT baselines. These
results demonstrate that cohort-level RL effectively enhances reasoning
consistency in LLMs.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 挑战推理痕迹内部安全的假设，揭示其潜在的隐私泄露问题。

Method: 通过提示注入和代理评估，测试推理步骤增加对隐私泄露的影响。

Result: 增加推理步骤会放大隐私泄露，尽管模型在最终答案上更谨慎。

Conclusion: 安全措施需扩展到模型的内部推理过程，而不仅是输出。

Abstract: We study privacy leakage in the reasoning traces of large reasoning models
used as personal agents. Unlike final outputs, reasoning traces are often
assumed to be internal and safe. We challenge this assumption by showing that
reasoning traces frequently contain sensitive user data, which can be extracted
via prompt injections or accidentally leak into outputs. Through probing and
agentic evaluations, we demonstrate that test-time compute approaches,
particularly increased reasoning steps, amplify such leakage. While increasing
the budget of those test-time compute approaches makes models more cautious in
their final answers, it also leads them to reason more verbosely and leak more
in their own thinking. This reveals a core tension: reasoning improves utility
but enlarges the privacy attack surface. We argue that safety efforts must
extend to the model's internal thinking, not just its outputs.

Abstract: Gender-inclusive machine translation (MT) should preserve gender ambiguity in
the source to avoid misgendering and representational harms. While gender
ambiguity often occurs naturally in notional gender languages such as English,
maintaining that gender neutrality in grammatical gender languages is a
challenge. Here we assess the sensitivity of 21 MT systems to the need for
gender neutrality in response to gender ambiguity in three translation
directions of varying difficulty. The specific gender-neutral strategies that
are observed in practice are categorized and discussed. Additionally, we
examine the effect of binary gender stereotypes on the use of gender-neutral
translation. In general, we report a disappointing absence of gender-neutral
translations in response to gender ambiguity. However, we observe a small
handful of MT systems that switch to gender neutral translation using specific
strategies, depending on the target language.

Abstract: With the popularity of large language models (LLMs), undesirable societal
problems like misinformation production and academic misconduct have been more
severe, making LLM-generated text detection now of unprecedented importance.
Although existing methods have made remarkable progress, a new challenge posed
by text from privately tuned LLMs remains underexplored. Users could easily
possess private LLMs by fine-tuning an open-source one with private corpora,
resulting in a significant performance drop of existing detectors in practice.
To address this issue, we propose PhantomHunter, an LLM-generated text detector
specialized for detecting text from unseen, privately-tuned LLMs. Its
family-aware learning framework captures family-level traits shared across the
base models and their derivatives, instead of memorizing individual
characteristics. Experiments on data from LLaMA, Gemma, and Mistral families
show its superiority over 7 baselines and 3 industrial services, with F1 scores
of over 96%.
